What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
