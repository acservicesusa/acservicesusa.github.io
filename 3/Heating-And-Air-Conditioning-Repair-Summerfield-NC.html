<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Summerfield NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
