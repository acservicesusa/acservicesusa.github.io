<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up evaluation results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
