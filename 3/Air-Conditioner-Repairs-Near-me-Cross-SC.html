<p>Call Miller's Air Conditioning & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and constantly consult with a valuable and live member of our team, who will immediately focus on your requirements. While our competitors punch a stringent time clock, we understand heating and cooling difficulties often arise outside of regular service hours. Rather than leave a message on a machine, make the most of tailored service and the timely reaction of radio dispatched trucks.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The absence of moving parts indicates you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
