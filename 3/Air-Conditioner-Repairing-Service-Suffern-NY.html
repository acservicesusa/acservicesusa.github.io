If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Some we pick to accept because to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the method we want. And some are dangers we may decide to prevent if we had the opportunity to make informed choices. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>

However, you'll conserve money over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source systems.
