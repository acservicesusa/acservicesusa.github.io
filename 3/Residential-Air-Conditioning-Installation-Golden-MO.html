<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact.

We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
