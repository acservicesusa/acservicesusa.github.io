They might recommend that you trim thick trees or bushes to ensure appropriate airflow around the system.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period.

The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>If you have a big house, a house with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
