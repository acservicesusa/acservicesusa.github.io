<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
