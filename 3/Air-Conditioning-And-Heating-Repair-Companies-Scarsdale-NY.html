<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime.

<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
