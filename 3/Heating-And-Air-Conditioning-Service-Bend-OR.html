<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Bend OR Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
