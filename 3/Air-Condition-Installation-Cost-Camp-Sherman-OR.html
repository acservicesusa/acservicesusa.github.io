<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
