<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Sandy OR HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump must be devoid of all blockages and particles. Obstructions can block the flow of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature level guideline, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture streams far from the system.<p>
