<p>Plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the total system if you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home. The size of the system identifies the labor hours involved to build the system. When you think about installation fees upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
