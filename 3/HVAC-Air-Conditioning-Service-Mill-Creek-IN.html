<p>Buildings are created or planned to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

We might discover it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to acquire an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
