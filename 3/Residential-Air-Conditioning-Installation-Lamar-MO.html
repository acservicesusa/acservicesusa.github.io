<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
