<p>Many household items release organic vapors that can cause adverse health impacts. These results might include nose and throat inflammation, headaches, dizziness, and queasiness. Products consisting of these vapors consist of paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby products, disinfectants, cleaners, and deodorizers. Formaldehyde is another natural vapor that can trigger similar symptoms.

They come in many different forms: wall-mounted systems that are great for small spaces like restrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heaters but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that offer a gentle sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
