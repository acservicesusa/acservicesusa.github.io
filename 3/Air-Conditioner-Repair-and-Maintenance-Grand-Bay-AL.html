<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping maker to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floors.
