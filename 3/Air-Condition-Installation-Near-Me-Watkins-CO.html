While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, locals must look out to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures should not be carried out until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
