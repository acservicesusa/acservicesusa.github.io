<p>Air conditioners can produce a great deal of water because they eliminate moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
