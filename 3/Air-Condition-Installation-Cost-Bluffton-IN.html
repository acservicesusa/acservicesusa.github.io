<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
