<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on numerous aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
