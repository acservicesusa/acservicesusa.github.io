<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location.
