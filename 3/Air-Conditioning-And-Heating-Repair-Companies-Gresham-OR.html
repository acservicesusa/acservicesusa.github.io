<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
