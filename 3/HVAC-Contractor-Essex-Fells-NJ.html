<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I required to contact these guys two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
