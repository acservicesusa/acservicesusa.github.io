<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
