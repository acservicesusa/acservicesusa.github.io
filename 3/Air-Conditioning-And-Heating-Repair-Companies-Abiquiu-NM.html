However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to minimize expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
