<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
