<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
