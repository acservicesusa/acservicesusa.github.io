Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
