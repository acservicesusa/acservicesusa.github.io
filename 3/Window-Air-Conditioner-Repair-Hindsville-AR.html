<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Hindsville Arkansas</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but significant changes in his quote. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
