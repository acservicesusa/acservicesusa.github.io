<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Hudson NH</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
