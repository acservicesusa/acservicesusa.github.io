<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this might invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
