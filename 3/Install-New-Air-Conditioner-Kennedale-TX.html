<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
