The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more data based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Wheat Ridge CO</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The first step to repairing any issue is identifying what the issue is in the top place. We waive our diagnostic fees if we find your system needs a significant repair. The parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts service warranty when we do any repair. If you have actually spoken to another company and received a quote, our diagnostics service and waived fee provide you with a second option that includes the service warranty bonus.<p>
