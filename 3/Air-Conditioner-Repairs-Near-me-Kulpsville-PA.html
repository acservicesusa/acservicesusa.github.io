Structures continuously evolve as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly communicating, and this interaction leads to modifications in each.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or wet structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continuously. Other sources, related to activities performed in the home, release pollutants intermittently.

High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
