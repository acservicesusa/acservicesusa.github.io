<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Cooke City MT</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
