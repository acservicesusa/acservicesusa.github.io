Load calculating is described as the Handbook J estimation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the correct size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
