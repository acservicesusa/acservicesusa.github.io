<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
