<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
