<p>Radiant heat uses a number of distinct advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transmitting heat through strong objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a glowing system will warm up faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
