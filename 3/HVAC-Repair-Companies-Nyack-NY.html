<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Nyack NY?</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
