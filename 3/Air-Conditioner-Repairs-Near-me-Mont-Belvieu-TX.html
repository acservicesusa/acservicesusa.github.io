However, much better brand names usually come with a longer lifespan, better guarantees, and smarter innovation built in to completely manage your home's temperature.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
