<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
