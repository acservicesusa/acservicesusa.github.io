<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
