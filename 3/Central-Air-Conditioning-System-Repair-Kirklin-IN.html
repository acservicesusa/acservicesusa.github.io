<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an air conditioning unit to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c unit: Don't put it in an egress window that serves as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, specifically if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and changing the air filters is one of the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
