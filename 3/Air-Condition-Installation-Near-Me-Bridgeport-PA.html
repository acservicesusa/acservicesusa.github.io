He committed to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring.

However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
