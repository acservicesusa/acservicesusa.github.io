They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
