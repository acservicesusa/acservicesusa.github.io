<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
