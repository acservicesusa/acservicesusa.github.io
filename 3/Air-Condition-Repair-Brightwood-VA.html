<p>The exhaust outlets enable all dangerous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. They can lead to an unsafe accumulation and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are blocked. The technician will assess all of these elements of your system and check the chimney flue and vent stack also. They will search for signs of rust, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
