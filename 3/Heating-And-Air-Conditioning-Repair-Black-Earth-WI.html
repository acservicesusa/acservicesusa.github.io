<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
