<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners.

While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
