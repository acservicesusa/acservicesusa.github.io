<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
