<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
