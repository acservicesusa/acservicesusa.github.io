<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
