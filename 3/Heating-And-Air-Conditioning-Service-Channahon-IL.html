<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Channahon IL Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
