<p>The very first ac system and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
