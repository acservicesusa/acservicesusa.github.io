<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>

Children might have greater exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
