<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC system is not draining pipes properly. A restriction in your drain pipelines triggers a water leak. There are many different locations a blockage can happen. One of the primary locations where clogs start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
