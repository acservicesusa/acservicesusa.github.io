<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.
