<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips.
