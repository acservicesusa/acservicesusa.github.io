<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã The majority of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. ItÃ¢ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
