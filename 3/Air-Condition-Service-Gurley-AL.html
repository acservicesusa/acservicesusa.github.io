<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
