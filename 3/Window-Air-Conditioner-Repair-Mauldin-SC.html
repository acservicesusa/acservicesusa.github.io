<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
