<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
