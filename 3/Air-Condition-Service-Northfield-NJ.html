<p>The homes and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These must be taken into consideration prior to selecting the best style of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer residential or commercial properties requires fewer pipelines to attain the wanted underground heating & cooling effect, while those with lowered thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
