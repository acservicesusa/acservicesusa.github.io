As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't think adequate about exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
