<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes comes up. It is really important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do discover your furnace behaving strangely. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the easier they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will only make the problem even worse, and often more pricey.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
