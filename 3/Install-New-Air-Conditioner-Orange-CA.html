<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

It's not constantly about picking the model with the highest SEER score, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can assist.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<p>We look at hints prior to we provide suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
