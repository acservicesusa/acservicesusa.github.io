<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
