<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
