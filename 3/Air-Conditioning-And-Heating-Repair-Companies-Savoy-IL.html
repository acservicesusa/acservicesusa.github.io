<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heatpump work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse.

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heatpump if temperature levels reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Even more recent heaters less than 5 years old have actually been discovered as bad. Too many homeowners are shocked to discover that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.
