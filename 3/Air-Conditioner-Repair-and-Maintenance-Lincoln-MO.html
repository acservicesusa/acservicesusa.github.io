According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard.
