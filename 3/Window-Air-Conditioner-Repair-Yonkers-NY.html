<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
