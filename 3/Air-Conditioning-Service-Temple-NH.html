<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
