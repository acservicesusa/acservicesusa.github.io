<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Riegelsville PA</h3>

They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
