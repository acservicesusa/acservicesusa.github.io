<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
