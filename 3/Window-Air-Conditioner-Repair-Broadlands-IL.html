<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
