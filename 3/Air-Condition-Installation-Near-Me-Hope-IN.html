What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
