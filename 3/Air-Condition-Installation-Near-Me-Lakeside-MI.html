<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an a/c unit to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Do not position it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
