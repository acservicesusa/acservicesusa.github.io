<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
