<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a really beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
