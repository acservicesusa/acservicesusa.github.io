<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.
