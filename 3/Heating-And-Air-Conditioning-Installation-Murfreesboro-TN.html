<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil.
