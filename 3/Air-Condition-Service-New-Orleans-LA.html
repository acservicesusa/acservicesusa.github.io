<h3>Furnace Replacement in New Orleans LA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
