A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of numerous rooms with one external unit.

<p>Location the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible.

Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>

During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
