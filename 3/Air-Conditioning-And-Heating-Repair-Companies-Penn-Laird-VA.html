<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings exhale co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread out throughout the whole workplace or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
