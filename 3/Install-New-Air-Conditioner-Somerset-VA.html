To ensure the system you choose is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the precise type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't just change it with the same size unit you currently have.

This action is essential so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
