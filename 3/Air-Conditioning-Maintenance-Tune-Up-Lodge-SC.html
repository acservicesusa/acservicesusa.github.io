<p>It's not suggested for uncertified individuals to examine & repair cooling & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best. When examining your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, always make sure. Be very cautious when examining capacitors, even with the a/c system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unforeseen discharge from an a/c capacitor can trigger serious injury or death.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
