<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have met in a very long time.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
