<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in New Boston NH</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
