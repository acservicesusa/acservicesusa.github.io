<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate problems-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, among the three strategies listed below may be suitable.<p>
