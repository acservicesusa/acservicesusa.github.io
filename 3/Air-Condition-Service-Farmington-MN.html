<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Farmington MN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to houses. In reality, many office buildings have significant air pollution sources A few of these structures might be improperly ventilated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems might not be designed or operated to offer adequate amounts of outside air. Finally, people typically have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they perform in their homes. As a result, there has been a boost in the incidence of reported illness.<p>
