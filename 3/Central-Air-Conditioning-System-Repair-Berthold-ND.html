<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not achieve an effectiveness higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well due to the fact that a drain requires to be installed.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are typically smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Anticipate the average mobile home oil furnace to have beginning expenses of around $1,500. Bear in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heating systems for this use, and you may discover more options with gas, propane, or electric heaters.<p>
