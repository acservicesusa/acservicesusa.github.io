<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them..

<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items produced indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we provide suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
