<p>A routine furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and provide longer long lasting home heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a simple maintenance call can determine a concern that will need a substantial financial investment to treat. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the expensive repair and delight in continued comfort from your existing heating unit? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary commitment to replacing the furnace?

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
