<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
