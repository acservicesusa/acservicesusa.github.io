<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.
