Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
