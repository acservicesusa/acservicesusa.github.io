<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
