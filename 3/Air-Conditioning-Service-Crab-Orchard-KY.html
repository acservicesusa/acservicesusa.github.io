If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. As with determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, identifying the proper size of system for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
