<p>Compounding the kept in mind health signs may be task stress. In part, due to various aspects of office automation, the most stressful elements of workplace work are increasing. Health signs related to task stress consist of mental and physical stress such as frustration, anxiety, irritation, anger, anxiety, stomach or gastro-intestinal disruptions, and muscle and psychological tension. These symptoms may be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
