<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Kuna ID</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
