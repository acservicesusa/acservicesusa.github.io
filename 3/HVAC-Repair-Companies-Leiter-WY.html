<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor.
