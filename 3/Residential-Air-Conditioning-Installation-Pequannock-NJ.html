<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Pequannock NJ</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy.
