<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
