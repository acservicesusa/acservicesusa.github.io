Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my good friends.<p>
