<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
