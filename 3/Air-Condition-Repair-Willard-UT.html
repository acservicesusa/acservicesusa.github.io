<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
