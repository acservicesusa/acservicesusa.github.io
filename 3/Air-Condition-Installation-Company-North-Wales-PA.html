<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
