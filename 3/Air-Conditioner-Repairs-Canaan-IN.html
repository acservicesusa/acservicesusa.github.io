<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into a space per an unit of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.
