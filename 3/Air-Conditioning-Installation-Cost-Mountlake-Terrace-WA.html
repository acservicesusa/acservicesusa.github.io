Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However many of the things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
