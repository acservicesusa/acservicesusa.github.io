<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, a lot of Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays.
