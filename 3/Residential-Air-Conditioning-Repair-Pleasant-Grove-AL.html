Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
