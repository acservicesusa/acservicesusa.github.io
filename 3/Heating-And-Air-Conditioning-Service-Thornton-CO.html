<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
