<p>The function of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Manual J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning.

Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
