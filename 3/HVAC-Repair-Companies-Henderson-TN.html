<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, therefore cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature stays consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer reliable and constant heating & cooling.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and extremely efficient, especially throughout the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's house. This is because the excess heat absorbed from within your house is conducted into the hot water tank rather than being transmitted back into the earth. The outcome, therefore, is free hot water! Moreover, during winter, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water alongside its main purpose of offering area heating. This suggests that cost savings are still realized throughout the cooler duration. In truth, a desuperheater decreases winter water heating costs by approximately half.<p>
