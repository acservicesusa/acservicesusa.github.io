The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
