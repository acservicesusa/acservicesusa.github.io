<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>
