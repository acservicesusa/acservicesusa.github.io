<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Lakeport CA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
