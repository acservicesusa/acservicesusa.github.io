<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
