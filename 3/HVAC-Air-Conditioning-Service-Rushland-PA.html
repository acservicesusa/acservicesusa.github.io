If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
