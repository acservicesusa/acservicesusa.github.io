Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an excellent task in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The technicians who set up the new system were expert and fast, while requiring time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
