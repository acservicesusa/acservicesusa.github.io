<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
