Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
