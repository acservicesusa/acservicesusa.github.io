<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
