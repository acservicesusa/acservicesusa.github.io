<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
