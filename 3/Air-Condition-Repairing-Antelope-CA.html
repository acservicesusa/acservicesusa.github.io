<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy intake and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air.
