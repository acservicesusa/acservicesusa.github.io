<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
