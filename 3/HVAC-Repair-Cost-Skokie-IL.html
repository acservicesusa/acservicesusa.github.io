<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Skokie IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
