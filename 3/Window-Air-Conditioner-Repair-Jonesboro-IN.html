<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
