<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air.
