<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
