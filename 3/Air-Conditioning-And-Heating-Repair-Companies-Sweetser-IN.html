Since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
