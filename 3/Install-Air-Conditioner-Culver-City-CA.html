<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Culver City CA</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
