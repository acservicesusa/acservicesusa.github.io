<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
