<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
