<p>Individuals working at Target aren't dumb or lazy and in this organisation all it takes is one tiny crack in your defenses and somebody will find it and pry you broad open, sometimes in simply a couple of days.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
