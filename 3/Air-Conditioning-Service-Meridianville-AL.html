<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Meridianville AL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
