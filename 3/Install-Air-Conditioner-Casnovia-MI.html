In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
