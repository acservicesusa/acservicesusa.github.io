<p>Whatever heater you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you desire produced.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
