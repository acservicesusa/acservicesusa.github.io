Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living.

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent employment growth for HVAC professionals between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations.

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
