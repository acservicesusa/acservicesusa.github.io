<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Sparks Glencoe MD</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need reasonably little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be examined at least two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
