<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
