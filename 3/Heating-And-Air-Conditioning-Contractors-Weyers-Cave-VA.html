<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
