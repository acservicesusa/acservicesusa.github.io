<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
