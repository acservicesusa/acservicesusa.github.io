<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time.
