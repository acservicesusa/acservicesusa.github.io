<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not necessarily translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning service tends to run cold and hot. Need warms up throughout the summer and winter when consumers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives.<p>
