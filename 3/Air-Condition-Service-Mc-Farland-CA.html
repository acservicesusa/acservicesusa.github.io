<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue.

The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Mc Farland CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>They take your coat, and you step out of your shoes, all set to take the tour. Then you stop. Something hits you as you base on the stone, and after that move in towards the hardwood floors.
