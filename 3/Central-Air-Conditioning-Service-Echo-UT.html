<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Echo Utah</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air may also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically closed down the heat pump if temperature levels reach and drop below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
