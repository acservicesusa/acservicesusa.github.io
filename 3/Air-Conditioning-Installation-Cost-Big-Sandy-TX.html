<p>Lots of people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is generally pictured as the black smoke emitted from factories.

<p>I have had the satisfaction of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and during that time, they have always provided excellent service.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.
