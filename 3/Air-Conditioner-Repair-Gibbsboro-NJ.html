However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
