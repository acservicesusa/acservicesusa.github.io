<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
