<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. Just be concerned if your home is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should call in a specialist to repair the unit and check.<p>

A structure walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be useful. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being infected with bacteria or fungis and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some scenarios, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
