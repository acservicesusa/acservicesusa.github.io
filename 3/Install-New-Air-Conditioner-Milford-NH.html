<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
