<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
