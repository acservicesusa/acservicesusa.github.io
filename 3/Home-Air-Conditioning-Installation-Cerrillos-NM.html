<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
