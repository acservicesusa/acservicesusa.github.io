<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
