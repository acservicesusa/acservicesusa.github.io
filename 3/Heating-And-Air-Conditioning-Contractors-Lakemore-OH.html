<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Since of our high standards for job quality and customer service, most of our customers pertain to us from recommendations - either personal referrals from buddies, or recommendations from home builders who trust Bob's Heating & Cooling and recommend us to brand-new homeowners. As our valued client, you can rely on us for quality service, financial efficiency, and expert installation. Demand the very best and end up being a Bob's Heating & Cooling consumer for life.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
