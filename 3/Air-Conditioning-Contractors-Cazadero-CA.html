<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but lead to higher energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long run. Rates for gas heaters vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heaters start at $395 and range up to $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>

Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
