<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
