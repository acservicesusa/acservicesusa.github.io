<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces in Mount Hamilton CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
