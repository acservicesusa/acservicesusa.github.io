<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Verona WI</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
