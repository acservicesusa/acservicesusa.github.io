<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Ocean City NJ</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, a lot of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
