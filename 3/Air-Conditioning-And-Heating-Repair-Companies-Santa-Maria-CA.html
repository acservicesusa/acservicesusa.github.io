Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
