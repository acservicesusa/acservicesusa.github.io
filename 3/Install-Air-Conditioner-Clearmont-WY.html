The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can differ substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may need absolutely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can also differ considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In many cases, totally brand-new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time.
