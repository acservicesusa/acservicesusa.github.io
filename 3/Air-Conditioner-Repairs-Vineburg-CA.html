<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
