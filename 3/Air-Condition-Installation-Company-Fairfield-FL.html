<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
