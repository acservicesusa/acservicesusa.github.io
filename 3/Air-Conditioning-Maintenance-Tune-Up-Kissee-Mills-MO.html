Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
