<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
