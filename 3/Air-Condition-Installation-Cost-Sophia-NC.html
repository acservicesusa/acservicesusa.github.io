<p>Numerous commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
