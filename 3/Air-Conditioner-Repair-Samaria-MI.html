<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your home may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
