The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>First make sure the air filter is tidy and in great condition if you observe a decline in heat output. Next, inspect other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dust, particles and dirt, an inexpensive fix that can assist boost efficiency. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction.
