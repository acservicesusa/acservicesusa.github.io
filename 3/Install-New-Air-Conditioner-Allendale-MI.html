Numerous common structure materials utilized before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Elimination of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimum because the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
