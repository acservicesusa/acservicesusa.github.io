<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Greenwich NJ</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
