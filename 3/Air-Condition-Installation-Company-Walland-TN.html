There have been awkward sounds. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. However then understood A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Do not panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power.
