<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
