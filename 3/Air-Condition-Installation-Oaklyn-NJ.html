While it might be pleasing, fun and even cost-effective, it is crucial that you possess some skills before trying to repair these issues.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or normal home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
