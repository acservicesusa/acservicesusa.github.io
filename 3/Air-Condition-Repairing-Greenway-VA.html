<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
