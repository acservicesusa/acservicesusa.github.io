Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
