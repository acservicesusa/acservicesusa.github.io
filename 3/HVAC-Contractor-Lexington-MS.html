Sometimes it's not a major problem, and your system might just need some maintenance work.

<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies provide concern consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
