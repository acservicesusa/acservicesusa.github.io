(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
