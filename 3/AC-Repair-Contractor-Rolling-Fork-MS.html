<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
