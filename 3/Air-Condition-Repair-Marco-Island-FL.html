<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
