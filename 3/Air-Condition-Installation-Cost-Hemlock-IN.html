<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
