<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
