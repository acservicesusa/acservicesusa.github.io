According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>

<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
