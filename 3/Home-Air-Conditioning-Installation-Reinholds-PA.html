<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
