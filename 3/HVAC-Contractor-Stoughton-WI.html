<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<p>When service is less hectic, it can be the ideal time to brainstorm innovative approaches for promoting your HVAC company too. For instance, you may try taking part in house and garden shows, trade convention or other sort of event marketing. Or perhaps you'll present a contest, a free gift or a special funding plan to improve equipment sales. You can formalize them as part of the marketing method you detail in next year's service strategy if the experiments pay off.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
