We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit.

<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been revealed to minimize levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, nevertheless, that a reasonable number of houseplants eliminate considerable amounts of toxins in offices and houses. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered due to the fact that extremely wet soil might promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
