As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
