We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment and large residences. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
