<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
