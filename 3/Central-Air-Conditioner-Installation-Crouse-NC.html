For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>

Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
