<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower total temperature level-- in some cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater." Simply put, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
