<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Webster MN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
