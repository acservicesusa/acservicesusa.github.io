<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
