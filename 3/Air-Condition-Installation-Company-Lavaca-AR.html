<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
