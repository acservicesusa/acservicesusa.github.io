This is generally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
