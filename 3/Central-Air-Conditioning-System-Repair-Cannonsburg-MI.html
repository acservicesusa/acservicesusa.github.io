Soil by highways and roads may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before going into the home. If you work with lead in your job or a pastime, alter your clothing prior to you go home and clean these clothing separately.
