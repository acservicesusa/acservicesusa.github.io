<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure.

<p>Heaters are devices whose function is to create heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done through central heating Such a system consists of a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central place such as a furnace space in a home, or a mechanical room in a big structure. The heat can be transferred by radiation, conduction, or convection Space heaters are utilized to heat single rooms and only consist of a single system.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
