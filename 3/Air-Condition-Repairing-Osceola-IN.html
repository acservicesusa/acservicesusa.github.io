<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many systems come with a set that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and protected fit in the window opening. And for extra support, particularly for bigger air conditioning system, think about acquiring a steel support bracket and mount it to the outside home wall, straight listed below the windowsill.<p>
