<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Damascus</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
