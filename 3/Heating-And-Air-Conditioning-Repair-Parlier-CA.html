All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>My oldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
