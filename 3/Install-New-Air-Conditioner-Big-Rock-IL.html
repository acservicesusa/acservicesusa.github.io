<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Given that ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear really complicated in the beginning, requiring specialized tools, devices, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
