This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that an employer should provide a healthy and safe work environment. Therefore, ensuring the air is of great quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last job is to check the system to make certain it cools effectively. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to switch on may just involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any issues or concerns and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
