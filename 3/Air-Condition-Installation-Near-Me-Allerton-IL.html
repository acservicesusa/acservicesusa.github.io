<p>A third method to choose whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
