<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air.
