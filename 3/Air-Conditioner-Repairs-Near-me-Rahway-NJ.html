The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
