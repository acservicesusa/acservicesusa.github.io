<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
