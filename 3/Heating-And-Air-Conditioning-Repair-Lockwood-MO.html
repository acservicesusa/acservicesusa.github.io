<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
