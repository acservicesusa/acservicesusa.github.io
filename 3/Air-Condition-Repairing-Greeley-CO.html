<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works however the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
