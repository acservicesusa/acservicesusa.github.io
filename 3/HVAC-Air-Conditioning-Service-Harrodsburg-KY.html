<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioner to replace my old one was rather of a challenging fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am grateful I got this though due to the fact that it has restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got since I purchased it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
