<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. More often than not they were initially interested in from another location keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't up until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they learned about and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to supply a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable consequences associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or common family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>Generally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
