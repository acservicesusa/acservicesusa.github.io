<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE.

<p>Immediate results may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces. Most contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
