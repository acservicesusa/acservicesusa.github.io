<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Spring Valley CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
