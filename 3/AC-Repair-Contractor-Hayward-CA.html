<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
