Installations can also differ significantly, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. Sometimes, entirely new ductwork might require to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new construction (houses normally use in between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.
