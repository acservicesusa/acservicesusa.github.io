<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be checked a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
