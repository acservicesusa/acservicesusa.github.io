<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
