Start by opening the heat registers and after that proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also inspect the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>

A voided guarantee won't do you any great should the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and hire a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
