<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
