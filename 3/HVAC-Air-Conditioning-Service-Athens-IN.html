<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the producer's directions.<p>
