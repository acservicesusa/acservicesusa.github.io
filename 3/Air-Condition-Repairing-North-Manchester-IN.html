<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in North Manchester Indiana</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy issue like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a few years ago.<p>
