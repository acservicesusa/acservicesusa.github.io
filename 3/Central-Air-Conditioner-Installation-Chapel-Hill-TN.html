<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. More often than not they were at first interested in from another location keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a much healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to avoid the negative repercussions connected with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do come with some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is also the result of the combustion process. This process produces exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide, which have to be vented to the outside of the house. Carbon monoxide is an odor-free gas, and is highly toxic in higher concentrations. A malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting problem could put your home's occupants in genuine risk because of this. It is exceptionally crucial to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to ensure your home has a carbon monoxide alarm installed.<p>
