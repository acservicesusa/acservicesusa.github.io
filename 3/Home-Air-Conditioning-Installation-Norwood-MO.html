<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
