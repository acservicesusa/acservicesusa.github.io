<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to manage the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in home to save cash on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will examine the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to guarantee the real temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to inspect the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the whole HVAC system if there's a difference in the temperature.<p>
