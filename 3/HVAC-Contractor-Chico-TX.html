<h3>Air Condition Service in Chico TX</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
