<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
