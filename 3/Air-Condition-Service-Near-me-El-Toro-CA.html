<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in location.

For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
