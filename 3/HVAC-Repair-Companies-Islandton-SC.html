<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
