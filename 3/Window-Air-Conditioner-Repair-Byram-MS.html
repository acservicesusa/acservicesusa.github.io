<p>The very first a/c and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
