<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Oak Island NC</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops fractures which leak, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy costs will increase. Installing brand-new ductwork for the entire home will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
