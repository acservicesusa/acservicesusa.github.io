<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
