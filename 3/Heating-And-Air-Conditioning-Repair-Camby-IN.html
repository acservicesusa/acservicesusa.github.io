They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Camby IN</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
