<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Essex IL</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that people spend around 90 percent of their time inside your home. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
