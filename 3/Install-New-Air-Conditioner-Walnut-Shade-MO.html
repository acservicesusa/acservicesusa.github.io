<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you prior to you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are typically mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and disorientation. The results of CO exposure can vary greatly from individual to person depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
