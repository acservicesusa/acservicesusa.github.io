However a lot of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
