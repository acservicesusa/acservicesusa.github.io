<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
