<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it.

For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
