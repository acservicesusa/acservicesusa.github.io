<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
