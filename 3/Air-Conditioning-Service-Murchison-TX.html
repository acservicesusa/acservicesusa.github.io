"Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Numerous factors impact IAQ. These elements include bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, specific contaminants like dust from construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas with time) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>
