<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
