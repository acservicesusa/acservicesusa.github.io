<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
