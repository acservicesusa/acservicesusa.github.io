<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
