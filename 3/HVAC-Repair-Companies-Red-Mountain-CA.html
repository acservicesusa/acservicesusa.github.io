<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Red Mountain CA?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
