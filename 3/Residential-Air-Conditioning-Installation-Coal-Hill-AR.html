<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
