<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste.

There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
