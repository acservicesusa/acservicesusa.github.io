<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
