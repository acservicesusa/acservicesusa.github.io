Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
