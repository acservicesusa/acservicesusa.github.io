<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a really effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
