<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
