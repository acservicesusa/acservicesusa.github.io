<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>
