Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered simply a few feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide trustworthy and constant heating and cooling.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks consist of 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them prior to you continue with repairs (Image 3). A blown fuse suggests a failing part inside the condensing system.
