They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.
