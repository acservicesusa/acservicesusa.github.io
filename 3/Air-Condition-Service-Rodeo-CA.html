In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
