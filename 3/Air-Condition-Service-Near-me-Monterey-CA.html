<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Monterey CA?</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
