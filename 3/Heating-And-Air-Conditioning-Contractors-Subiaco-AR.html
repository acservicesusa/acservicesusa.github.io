<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs.

The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
