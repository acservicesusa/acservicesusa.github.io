<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
