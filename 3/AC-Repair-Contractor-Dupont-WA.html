<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
