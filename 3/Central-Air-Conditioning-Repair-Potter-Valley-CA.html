<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
