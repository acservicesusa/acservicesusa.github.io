If you a furnace replacement in Westminster and the cost of the job is among your main issues, then you should act quickly to have your Westminster furnace replacement completed with an older design.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
