<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
