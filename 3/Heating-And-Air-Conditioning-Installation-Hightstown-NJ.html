<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and health centers, vehicles such as vehicles, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The most typical kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, but more recent systems can be extremely energy efficient.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
