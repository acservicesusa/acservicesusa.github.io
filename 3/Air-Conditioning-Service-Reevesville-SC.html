<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Reevesville South Carolina</h3>
<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
