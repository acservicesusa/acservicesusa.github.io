<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation place of a/c unit, numerous primary elements need to be considered.

The outside system needs to also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively discharged outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is extremely advisable to set up the a/c unit units in quickly accessible places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
