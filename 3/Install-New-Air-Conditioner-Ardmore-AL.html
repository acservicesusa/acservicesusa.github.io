The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Ductwork Installation in Ardmore AL</h3>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
