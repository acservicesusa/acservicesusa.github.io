<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
