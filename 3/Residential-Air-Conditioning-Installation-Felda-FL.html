<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
