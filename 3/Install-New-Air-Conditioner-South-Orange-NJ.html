<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and preserve.<p>
