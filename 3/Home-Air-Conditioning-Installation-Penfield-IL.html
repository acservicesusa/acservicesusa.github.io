<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
