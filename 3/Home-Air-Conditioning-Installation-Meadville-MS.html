<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
