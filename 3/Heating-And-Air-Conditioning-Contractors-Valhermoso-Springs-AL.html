<p>Iâ $ m actually particular with my things. I like my devices and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioning system to change my old one was somewhat of a difficult truth. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am grateful I got this however because it has actually restored my faith in excellent production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Provider I got considering that I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just ideal.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
