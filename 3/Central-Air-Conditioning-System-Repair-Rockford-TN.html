<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and work environments matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Ac system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity.
