<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services offered.

Nevertheless, some makers need regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
