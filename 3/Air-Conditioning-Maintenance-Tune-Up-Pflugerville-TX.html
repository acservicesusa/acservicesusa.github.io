<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
