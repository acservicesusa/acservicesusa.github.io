Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
