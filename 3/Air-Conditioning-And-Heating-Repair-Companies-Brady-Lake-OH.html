<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
