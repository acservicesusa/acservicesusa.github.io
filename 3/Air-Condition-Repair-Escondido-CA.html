<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer care at the end of the appointment by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
