<p>Lots of indoor air toxins come from the cooking area. Gas stoves release hazardous pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those same pollutants in lower levels, along with other particles that can be easily taken in into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, make certain to switch on your kitchen area vents, or open a window to help filter out the air much more.<p>
<p>You might upgrade to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air escapes the system.<p>
