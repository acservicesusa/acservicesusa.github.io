"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
