Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
