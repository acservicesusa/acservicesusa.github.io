<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
