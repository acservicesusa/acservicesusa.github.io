<p>Numerous individuals are becoming more concerned and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing pollutants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be eliminated to revitalize the quality and boost of indoor air and improve the cooling.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
