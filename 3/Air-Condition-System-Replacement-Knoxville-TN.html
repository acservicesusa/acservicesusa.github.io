<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off.
