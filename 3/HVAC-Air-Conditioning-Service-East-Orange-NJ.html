<p>When central air conditioning service fails during a heat spell, you may have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll probably pay at least several hundred for the repair.

If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
