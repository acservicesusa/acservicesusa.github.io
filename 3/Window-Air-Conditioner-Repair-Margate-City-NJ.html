<h3>Central Heating Systems in Margate City NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
