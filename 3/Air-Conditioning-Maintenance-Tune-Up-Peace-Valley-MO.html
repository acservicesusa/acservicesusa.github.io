Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
