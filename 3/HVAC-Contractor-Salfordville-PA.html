<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
