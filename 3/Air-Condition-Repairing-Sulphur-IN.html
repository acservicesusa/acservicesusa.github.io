<h3>Air Condition System in Sulphur Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>There are some more major dangers for HVAC employees that could be possibly fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be poisonous.

Does your blower turn on and off frequently or does it blow cold air in some cases? If so, this is a sign that your furnace might require to be changed.<p>
