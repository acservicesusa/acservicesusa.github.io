<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
