<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
