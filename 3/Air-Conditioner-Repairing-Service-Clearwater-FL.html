<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Clearwater FL</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
