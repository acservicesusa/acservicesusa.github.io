<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year back and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I required well, and are always on-time and professional. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
