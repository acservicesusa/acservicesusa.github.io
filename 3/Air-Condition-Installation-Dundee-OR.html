<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Dundee OR?</h3>

If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. Call a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
