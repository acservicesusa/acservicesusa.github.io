<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Austell</h2>

On Long Island where we are located, as anywhere else, there are reliable contractors and those who are less trustworthy.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
