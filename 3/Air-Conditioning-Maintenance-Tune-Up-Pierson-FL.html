<p>Structures are developed or meant to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surface areas to boost their performance, longevity, or look. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even drastically modify buildings in ways that might be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the techniques used by researchers studying environments, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our structures.<p>

You do not have the tools, or the know-how, to be sure that you conduct those procedures safely and correctly. Experts, however, do have the tools and know-how to do the job properly.
