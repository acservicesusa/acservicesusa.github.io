Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.
