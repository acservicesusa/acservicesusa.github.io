<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Trevilians VA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings.

Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the required electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
