<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.

Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>

<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Wesson MS</h3>
