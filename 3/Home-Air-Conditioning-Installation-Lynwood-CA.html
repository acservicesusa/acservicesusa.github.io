<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years ago.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
