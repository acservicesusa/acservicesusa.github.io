<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
