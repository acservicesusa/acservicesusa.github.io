<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce adverse health conditions.

Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too.
