<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last floor surface. This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
