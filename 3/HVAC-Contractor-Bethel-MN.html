Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>

Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
