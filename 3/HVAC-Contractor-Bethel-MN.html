Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
