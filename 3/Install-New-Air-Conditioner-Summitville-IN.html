It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on.

Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
