<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
