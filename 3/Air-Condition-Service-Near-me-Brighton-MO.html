The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
