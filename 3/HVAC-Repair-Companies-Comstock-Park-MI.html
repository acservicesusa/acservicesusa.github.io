<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
