Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. However then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
