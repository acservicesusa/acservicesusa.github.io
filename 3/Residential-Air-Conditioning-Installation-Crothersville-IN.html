<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
