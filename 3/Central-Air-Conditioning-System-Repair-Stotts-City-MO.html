<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
