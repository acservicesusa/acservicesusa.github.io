Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological pollutant. Biological contaminants in the house might include mold, bacteria, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause transmittable illness such as Legionnaires' illness.

<p>Certain instant results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to identify if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are connected with exposure to contaminants from microorganisms that can grow in large structure ventilation systems. Nevertheless, these illness can likewise be traced to bacteria that grow in house heating and cooling humidifiers and systems.
