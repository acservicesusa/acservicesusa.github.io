<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
