<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
