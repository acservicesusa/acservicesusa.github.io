G & S Heating Cooling & Electric utilizes only the most professional HVAC service technicians, with years of experience in AC installation. No matter what your special situation is, we can find an air conditioning system that will meet your requirements. Once you decide on a suitable AC system, we can set up the entire thing for you, start to complete. By trusting us with your AC installation, you can rest assured that it will be done securely and expertly.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must examine measurements of air, temperature and humidity circulation. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for building usage and tenancy) should be performed. A building walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings may be helpful. Leakages need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become infected with fungis or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the general indoor air quality fulfills a certain standard. Occupational exposure limitations listed in health and wellness regulations and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to avoid illness or particular results (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial circumstances. These limitations might not be proper in office settings or for the house.<p>
