<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.
