<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks.

The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air.
