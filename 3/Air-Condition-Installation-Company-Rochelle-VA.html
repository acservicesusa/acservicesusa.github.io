<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
