<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Heating Service in Fairview UT</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions must also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents need to be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps should not be carried out till these problems have been fixed.<p>

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
