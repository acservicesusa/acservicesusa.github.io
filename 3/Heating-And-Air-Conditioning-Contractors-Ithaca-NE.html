<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
