<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
