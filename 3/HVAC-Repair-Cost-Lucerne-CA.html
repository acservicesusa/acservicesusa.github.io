<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>These men have actually been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what deal with a house might cost.

Stability isn't simply their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>

Any interference or disturbance in the circulation of electrical power makes the system inoperable. This is among the drawbacks to installing an electric radiant heat system.
