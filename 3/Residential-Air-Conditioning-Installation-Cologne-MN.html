<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the ac system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
