<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
