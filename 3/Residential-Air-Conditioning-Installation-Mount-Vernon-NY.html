<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
