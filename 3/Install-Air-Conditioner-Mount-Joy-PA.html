<p>The most common type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive alternative, but newer systems can be very energy efficient.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
