<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
