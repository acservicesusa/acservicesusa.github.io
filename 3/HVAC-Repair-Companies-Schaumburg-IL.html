<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which usually consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
