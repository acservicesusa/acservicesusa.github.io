<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
