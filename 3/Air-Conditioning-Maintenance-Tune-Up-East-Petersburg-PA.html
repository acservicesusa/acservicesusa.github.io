<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in East Petersburg PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
