<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main elements need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there must not be any challenges en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively released outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely recommended to install the a/c unit systems in quickly available places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
