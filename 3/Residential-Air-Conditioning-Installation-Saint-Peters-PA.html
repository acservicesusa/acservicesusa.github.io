He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
