<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Wyoming MI?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
