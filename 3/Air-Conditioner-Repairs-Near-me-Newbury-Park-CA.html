<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All of us deal with a variety of threats to our health as we tackle our everyday lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in planes, participating in recreational activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all present varying degrees of risk. Some dangers are simply inescapable. Some we choose to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the method we want. And some are risks we may choose to prevent if we had the opportunity to make informed options. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by certified HVAC specialists. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
