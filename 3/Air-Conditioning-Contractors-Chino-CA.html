<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you live in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to.

<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
