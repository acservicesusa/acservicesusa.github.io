In addition, homeowners must be alert to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures ought to not be undertaken till these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide advice to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy.
