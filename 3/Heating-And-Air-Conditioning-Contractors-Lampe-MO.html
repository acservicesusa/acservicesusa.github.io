<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Lampe MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

You pay more for the installation as well due to the fact that a drain needs to be set up.<p>
