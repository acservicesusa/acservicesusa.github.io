Compare the various furnace effectiveness ratings suggested by the individual contractors to pick the design and system that best matches your energy needs. Remember that energy-star ranked equipment will conserve you cash in the end but may include a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
