<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
