<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
