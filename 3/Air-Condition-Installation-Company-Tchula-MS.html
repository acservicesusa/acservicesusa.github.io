<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
