<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>Radiant heating uses a variety of distinct advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

A home heated up by a radiant system will heat up much faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
