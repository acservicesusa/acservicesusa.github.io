The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
