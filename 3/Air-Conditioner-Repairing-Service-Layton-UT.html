<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot house. You can rely on us to get the job done right.

<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>In addition, HVAC services typically need to pay licensing and accreditation fees, so make sure to have a look at the specific HVAC licensing requirements in your state.
