<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. Since they just partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure.

<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
