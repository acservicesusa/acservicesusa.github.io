<p>A health survey should be developed and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool should recognize the variety of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the office; show the kind of outside air contamination; and determine prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
