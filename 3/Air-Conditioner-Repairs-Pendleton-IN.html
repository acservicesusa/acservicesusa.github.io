<p>All of us face a variety of dangers to our health as we go about our day-to-day lives.

If we had the opportunity to make educated options, and some are threats we might decide to avoid. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
