<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Russell</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves checking the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are secure and tight.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
