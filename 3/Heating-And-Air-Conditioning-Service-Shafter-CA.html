<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
<p>Outside pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
