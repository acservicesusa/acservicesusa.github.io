<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
