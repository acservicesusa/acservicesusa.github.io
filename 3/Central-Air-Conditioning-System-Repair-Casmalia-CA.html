<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the various homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row real estate, etc.).

<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
