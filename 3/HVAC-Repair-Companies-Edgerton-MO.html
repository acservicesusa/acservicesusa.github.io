<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
