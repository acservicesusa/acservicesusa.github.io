<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>There are many things to take into account when attempting to determine how often I need to change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one a/c filter need replacing regularly.<p>

<p>As a skilled HVAC professional, we suggest you have your systems inspected and regular maintenance carried out two times per year, as soon as in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and when in the Fall (before heating season).

Keeping what is probably the most costly and important system in your home (heating & cooling) appropriately preserved will assist keep your biggest investment of your life in great shape.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very important to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>
<p>Since they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
