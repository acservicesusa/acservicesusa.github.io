<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
