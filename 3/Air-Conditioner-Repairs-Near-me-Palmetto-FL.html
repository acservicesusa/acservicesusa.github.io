PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them.

Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
