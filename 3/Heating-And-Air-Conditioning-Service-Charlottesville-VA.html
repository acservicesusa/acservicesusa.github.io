<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy.
