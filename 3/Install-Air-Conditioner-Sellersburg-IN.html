<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
