It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives.

We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
