<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
