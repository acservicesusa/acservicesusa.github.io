<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing flooring heating or can be installed in a new building.

The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is crucial iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Generally, a 3-ton setup needs to be sufficient for the average home, however house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all elements which will affect the proper size for your specific house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
