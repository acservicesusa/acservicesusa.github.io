He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.

I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
