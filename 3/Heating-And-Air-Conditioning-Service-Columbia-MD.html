Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, cigarette smoking, household products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
