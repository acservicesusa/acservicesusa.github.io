<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
