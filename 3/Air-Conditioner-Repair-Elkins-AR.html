<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.

We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
