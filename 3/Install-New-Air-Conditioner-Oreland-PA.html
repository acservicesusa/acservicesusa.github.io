<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer advice to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
