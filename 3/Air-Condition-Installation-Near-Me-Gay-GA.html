<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or perhaps transferring prone residents.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
