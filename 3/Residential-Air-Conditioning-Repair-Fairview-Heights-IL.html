<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
