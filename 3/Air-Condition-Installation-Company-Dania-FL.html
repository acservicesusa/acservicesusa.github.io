<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters including a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you select for your home. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a certified electrical contractor to link the system to your power supply, this may take a few hours and can cost anything between $200 and $250 dependant on who you pick and where you live.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
