<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
