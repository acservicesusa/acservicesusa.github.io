<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain harmful substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
