<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

In the majority of areas of the nation, cooling companies have the ability to charge more throughout spring and summertime due to high need.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.
