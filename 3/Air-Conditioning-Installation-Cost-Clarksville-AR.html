<p>Oil heating systems are usually not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems.
