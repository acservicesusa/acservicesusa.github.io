<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average salaries for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>To start, it's an excellent concept to think of energy effectiveness. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save money in the long run.

<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
