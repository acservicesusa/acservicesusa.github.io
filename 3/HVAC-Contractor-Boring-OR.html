A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are fantastic for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy.
