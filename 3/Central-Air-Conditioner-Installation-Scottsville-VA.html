<p>Although installation is simple and does not require much time, trying this task is not a great idea.

The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but typically include very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of adjusting normal warm water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.<p>

This makes geothermal heating a offered and dependable  source of energy.<p>
