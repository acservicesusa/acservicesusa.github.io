<p>Air toxins can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
