Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
