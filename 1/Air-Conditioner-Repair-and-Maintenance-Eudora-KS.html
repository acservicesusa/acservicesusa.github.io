<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Eudora KS</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
