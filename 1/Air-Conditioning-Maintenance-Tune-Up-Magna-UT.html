<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
