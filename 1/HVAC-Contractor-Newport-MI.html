<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company eventually.

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
