<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
