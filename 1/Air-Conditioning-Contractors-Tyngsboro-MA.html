<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

The structure type included both residential and commercial. The majority of samples examined were evaluated favorable for fungis and germs.<p>
