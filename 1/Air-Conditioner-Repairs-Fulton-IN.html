Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
