<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be efficiently determined or remedied without an extensive building examination.
