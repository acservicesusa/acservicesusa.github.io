<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
