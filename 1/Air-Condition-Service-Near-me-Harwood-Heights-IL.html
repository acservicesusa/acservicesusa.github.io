<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp ports ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
