<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Due West SC</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release toxins more or less continually.
