<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not present a substantial health threat on their own, the majority of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health impacts pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the results noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
