<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window.

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
