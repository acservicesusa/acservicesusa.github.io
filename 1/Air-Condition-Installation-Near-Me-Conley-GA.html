Keeping what is most likely the most crucial and costly system in your house (heating and cooling) effectively kept will help keep your most significant investment of your life in excellent shape.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
