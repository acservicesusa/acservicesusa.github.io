<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality.

<p>The life-span of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
