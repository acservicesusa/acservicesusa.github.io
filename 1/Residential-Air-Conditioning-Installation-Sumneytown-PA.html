<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Sumneytown PA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
