<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was unbelievable, informative and valuable - his work was impressive!

We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
