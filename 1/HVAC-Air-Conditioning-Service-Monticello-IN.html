<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
