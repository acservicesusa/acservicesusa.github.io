<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
