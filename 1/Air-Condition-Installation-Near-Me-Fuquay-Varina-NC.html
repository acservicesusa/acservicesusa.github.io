<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
