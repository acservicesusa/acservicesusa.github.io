<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. For instance, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers throughout the slow season can help relieve the peak season pressure on your tech team, as kept in mind in Cooling, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Technicians can mostly concentrate on reacting to calls from brand-new consumers, while your established customers remain delighted as their HVAC systems hum along well thanks to proactive examinations. The marketing part of your service plan for an HVAC company need to consist of how you'll promote these kinds of services.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
