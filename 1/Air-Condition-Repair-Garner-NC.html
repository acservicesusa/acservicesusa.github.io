<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
