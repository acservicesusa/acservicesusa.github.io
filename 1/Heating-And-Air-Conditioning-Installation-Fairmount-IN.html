<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of units feature a kit that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will ensure an airtight and safe fit in the window opening.
