<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 on average.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
