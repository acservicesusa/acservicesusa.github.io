<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home.
