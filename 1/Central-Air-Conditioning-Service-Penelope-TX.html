<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Penelope TX</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
