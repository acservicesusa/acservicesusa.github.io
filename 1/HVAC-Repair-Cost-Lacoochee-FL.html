<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
