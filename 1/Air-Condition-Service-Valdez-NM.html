<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.
