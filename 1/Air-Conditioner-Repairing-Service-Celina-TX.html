<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
