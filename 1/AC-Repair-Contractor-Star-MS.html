<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
