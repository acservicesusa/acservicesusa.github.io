<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
