<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
