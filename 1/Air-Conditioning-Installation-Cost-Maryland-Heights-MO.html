<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Maryland Heights MO</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
