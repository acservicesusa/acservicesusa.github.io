<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing but excellent things to say - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
