<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air.
