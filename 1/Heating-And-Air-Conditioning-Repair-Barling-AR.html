<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
