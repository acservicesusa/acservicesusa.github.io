<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Jeffersonville KY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in regards to ecological costs. Since the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it protects the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or pollutants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating unit that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>You depend on your heating system at all times when you're trying to push through a cold winter in Seattle.
