<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Eckerty IN</h3>

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
