The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
