I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
