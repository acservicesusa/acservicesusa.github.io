<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
