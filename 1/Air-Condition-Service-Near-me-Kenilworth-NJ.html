My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
