<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires dealt with by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
