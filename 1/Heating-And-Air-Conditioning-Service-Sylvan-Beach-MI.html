<p>A health questionnaire should be established and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool must determine the variety of people affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the work environment; show the kind of outside air pollution; and determine prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the result of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air blood circulation. Work environment temperature levels should be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your medical professional about them.
