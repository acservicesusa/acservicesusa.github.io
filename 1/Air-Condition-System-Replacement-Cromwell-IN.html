Other's experiences with the company can answer these and lots of other concerns.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy.
