Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
