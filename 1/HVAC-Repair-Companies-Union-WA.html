<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
