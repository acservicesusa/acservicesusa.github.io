<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean the condenser coil.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be better to replace the whole system.<p>
