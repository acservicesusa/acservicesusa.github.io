<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
