<p>Specialist heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
