Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants.
