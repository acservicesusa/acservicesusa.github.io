Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
