<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
