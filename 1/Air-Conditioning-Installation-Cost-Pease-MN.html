<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
