<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump normally need excavation to set up, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
