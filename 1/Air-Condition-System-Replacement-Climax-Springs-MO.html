<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began.
