<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
