<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.
