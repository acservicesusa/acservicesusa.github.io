<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioner: Don't place it in an egress window that acts as the only ways of escape must a fire appear.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your home lies, the local area's climate can change considerably.
