Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
