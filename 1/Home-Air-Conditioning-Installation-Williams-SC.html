<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
