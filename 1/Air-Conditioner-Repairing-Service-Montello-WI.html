<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Montello WI</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
