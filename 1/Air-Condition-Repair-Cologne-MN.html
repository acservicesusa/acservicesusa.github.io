<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit will not have the ability to cool your home correctly. When shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>

By choosing a central AC system that has as high of an effectiveness ranking as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run. Efficiency scores must be labeled with all systems. While effective units may cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated device is a terrific way to enjoy extra peace of mind.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
