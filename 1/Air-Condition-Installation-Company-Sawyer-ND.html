<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
