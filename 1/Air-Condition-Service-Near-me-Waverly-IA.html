<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home.
