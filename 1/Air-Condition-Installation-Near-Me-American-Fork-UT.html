<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves inspecting the recommended connections as well as temperature and pressure evaluates.
