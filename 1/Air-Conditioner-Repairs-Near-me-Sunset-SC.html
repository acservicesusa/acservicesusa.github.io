<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
