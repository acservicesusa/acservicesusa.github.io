<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
