<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Clarkridge AR</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
