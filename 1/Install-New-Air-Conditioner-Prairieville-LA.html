<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Prairieville LA?</h3>

It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
