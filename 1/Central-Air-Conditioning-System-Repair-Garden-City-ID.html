<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
