<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some time. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
