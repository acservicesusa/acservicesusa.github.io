<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be smarter to replace the entire system.<p>
