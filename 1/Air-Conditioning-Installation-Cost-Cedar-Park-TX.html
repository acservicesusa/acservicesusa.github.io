<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Lots of people are ending up being more aware and worried about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing contaminants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Sometimes it must be removed to refresh the quality and boost of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans the air ducts physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
