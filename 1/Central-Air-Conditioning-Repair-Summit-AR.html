<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
