<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Beavercreek OR</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is stopped up or dirty Before trying to repair any issue, require time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with an experienced technician.<p>

The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.
