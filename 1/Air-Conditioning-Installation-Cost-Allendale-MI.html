<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Our technicians are trained, experienced and accredited to set up, keep and repair commercial and residential ventilation, heating and air conditioning devices and to clean and inspect your chimney or ventilation shaft. Our group does outstanding work, whether it's dealing with conventional HVAC work or dealing with the quirks of brownstones, prewar buildings and other structures not easy to heat or cool.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Energy Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
