<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
