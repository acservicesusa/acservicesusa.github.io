<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Contractors in New Vernon NJ</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were very expert, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
