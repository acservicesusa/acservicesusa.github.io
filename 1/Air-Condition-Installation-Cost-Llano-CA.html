<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
