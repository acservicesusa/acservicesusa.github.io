<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
