<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.
