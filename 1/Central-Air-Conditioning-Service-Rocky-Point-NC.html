<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Lots of disconnect blocks consist of 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them prior to you proceed with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing system.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>These guys have been excellent. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I needed to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
