A more energy efficient house will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, but it will greatly enhance the comfort of your house. Before we design and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise several certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>

<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company at Alden NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last job is to test the system to make sure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This last check might explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to turn on may just include a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>
