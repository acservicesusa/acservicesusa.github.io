In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>

The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
