<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
