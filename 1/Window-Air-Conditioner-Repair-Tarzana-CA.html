<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently.

<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
