<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Norco CA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
