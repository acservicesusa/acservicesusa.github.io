<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
