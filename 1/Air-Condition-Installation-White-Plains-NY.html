Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up.
