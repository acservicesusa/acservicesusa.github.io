<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
