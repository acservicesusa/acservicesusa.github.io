<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the house.

An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items.
