<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items.
