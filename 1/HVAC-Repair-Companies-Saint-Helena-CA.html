<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
