<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
