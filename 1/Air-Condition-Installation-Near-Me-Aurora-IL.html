<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool should recognize the variety of people impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the workplace; show when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health signs or diseases; identify all makers run in the workplace; indicate the type of outdoors air pollution; and determine potential sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may become really unclean. These aspects of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all components, and checks connections to ensure they are protected. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for correct function and total condition. This is an exceptional opportunity to identify parts that are used or faulty. Changing them to repair the a/c may be a lot cheaper when the issue is relatively minor.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
