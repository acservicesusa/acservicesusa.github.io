Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
