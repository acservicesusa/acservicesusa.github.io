<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
