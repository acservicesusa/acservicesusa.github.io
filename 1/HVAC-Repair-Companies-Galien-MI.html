<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them till they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
