After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
