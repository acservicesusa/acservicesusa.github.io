<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Fontana</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However many of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.
