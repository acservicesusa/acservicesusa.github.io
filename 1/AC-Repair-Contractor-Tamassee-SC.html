<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Tamassee South Carolina</h3>
<p>Furnaces resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only need another part replaced or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
