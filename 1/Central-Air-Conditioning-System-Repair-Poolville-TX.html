<p>Even newer heaters less than five years of ages have been found as bad. A lot of house owners are stunned to discover that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
