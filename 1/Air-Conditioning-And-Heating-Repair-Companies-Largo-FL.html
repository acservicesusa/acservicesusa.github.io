<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
