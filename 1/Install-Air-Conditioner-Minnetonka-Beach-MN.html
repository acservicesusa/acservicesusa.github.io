<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

Hope this helps.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in chillier environments were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floorings, walls and ceilings heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen.
