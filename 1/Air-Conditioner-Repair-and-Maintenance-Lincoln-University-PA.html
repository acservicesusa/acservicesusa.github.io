<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
