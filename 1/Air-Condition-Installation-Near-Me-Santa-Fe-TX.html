<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Santa Fe TX</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
