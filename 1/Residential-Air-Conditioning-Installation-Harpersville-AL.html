<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Area control includes moving the pollutant source far from residents or even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside your home is connected with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
