<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

Likewise, if the procedure does not work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it frequently, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
