<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more environment-friendly and energy-efficient than traditional A/cs. Due to the fact that you can turn off private rooms when you're not occupying them, this is.

They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate problems-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be suitable.<p>
