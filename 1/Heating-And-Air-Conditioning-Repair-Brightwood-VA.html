<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
