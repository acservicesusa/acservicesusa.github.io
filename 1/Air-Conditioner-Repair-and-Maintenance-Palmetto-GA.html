<h3>Powerful Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Palmetto GA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
