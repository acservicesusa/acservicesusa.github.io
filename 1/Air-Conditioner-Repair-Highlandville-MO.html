<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Highlandville Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

Trane heat pump has worked very well and is so efficient that it considerably decreased our utility costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergency situations they reacted rapidly and solved the problem.<p>
