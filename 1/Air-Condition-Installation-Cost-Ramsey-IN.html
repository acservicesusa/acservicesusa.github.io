Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
