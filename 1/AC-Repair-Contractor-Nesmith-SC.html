<p>Air conditioning unit makers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioner stops working, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Nesmith SC Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using smart innovation.

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
