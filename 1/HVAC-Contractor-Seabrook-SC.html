<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice.

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can often be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative ought to request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
