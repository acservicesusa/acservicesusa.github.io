<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
