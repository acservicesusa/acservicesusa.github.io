<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish a performance higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
