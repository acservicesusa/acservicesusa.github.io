<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially because we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>For example, problems emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
