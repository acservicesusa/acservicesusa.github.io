The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, lowering air flow volume, quality, and circulation. They likewise may end up being locations for bacteria and molds to grow and be dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be effectively maintained to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
