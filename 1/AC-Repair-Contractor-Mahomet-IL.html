<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. You might not yet understand for specific what you need in your home. Luckily we can assist.

<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older.

<p>Often, a repair may repair something in the short term, however a new installation would be the very best option in the long term. The very best HVAC company will set reasonable expectations for the client and help them consider future cost or maintenance.

<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also help control bacteria and natural odors. Most store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and don't get rid of germs and gases.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new home owner I have discovered how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
