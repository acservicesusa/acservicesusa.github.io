Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the professionals thought they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
