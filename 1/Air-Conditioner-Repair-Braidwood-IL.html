<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
