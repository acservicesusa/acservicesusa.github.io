<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Oak Ridge NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
