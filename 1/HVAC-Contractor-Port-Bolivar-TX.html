<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
