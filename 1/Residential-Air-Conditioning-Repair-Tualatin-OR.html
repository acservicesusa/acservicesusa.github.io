<h3>House Ventilation in Tualatin OR</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer support at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
