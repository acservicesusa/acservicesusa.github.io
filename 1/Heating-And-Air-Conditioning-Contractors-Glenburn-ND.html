<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
