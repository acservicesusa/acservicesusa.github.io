<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
