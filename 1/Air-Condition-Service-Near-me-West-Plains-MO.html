<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
