<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Nutley NJ</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
