Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>

The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Generally, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
