<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
