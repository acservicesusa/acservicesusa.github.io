I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
