<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
