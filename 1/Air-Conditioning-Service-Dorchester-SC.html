<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
