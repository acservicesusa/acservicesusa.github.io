<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify issues.

In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be familiar with a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that may be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
