<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your San Marcos CA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>

<p>Lots of commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems.

You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit may end up being extremely dirty.
