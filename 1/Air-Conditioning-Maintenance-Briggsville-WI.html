<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
