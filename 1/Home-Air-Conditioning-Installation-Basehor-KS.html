<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
