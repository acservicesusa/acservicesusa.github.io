<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
