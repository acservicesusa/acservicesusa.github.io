<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative ought to request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this data may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
