<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>To secure family members with asthma or to reduce the possibility that somebody in the home may establish asthma, the home needs to be examined for potential indoor asthma activates. Each space in the home has potential asthma sets off. Some issues can be fixed rapidly, however others might need more time and work to manage or get rid of asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix problems, such as chemical odors and scents, add to indoor air pollution and have actually been known to asthma symptoms in delicate people. Other sources of indoor air contamination may be harder to reveal. For example, the use of room deodorizers may mask the smell of mold. If the source of musty smells can be found and eliminated, it will enhance the indoor air quality.<p>
