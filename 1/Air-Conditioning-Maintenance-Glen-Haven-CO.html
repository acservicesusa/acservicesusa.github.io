When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat moved heat to other articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources.
