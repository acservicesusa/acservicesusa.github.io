Depending upon the type of system set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
