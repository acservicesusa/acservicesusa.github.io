<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become blocked with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in just a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
