The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has performed.

<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the situation instantly.<p>

Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
