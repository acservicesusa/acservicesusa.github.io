The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has performed.

Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
