<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Medaryville IN</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
