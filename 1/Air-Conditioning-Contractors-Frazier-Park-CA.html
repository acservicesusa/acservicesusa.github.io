<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A split air conditioner consists of 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit.
