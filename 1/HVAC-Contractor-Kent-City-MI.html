<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Kent City MI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
