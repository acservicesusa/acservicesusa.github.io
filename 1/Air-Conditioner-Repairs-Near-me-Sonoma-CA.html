<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
