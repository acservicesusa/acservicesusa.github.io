<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location using established health department suggestions.<p>
