<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least pricey option, but newer systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient gas furnaces can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
