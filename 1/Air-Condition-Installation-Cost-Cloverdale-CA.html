<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
