<p>Professional heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new.
