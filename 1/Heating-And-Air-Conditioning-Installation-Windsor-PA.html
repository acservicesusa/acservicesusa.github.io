The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in majority the workplace indoor air examinations it has actually conducted. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
