<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>There's a huge distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of houses in colder climates were warmed by convection, rather than radiation.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
