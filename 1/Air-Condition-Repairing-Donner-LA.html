<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
