Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked effectively and is so effective that it significantly minimized our energy expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they responded quickly and solved the issue.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
