<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
