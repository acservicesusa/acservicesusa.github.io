<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
