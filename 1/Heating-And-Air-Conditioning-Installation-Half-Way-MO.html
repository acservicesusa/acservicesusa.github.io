<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to offer threshold alerts. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the circumstance immediately.<p>
