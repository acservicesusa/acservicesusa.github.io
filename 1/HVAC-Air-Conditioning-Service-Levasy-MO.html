<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response data which reveal the health results of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical.

<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
