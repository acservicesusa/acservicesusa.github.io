I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
