<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-effective service.<p>
