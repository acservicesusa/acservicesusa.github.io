<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
