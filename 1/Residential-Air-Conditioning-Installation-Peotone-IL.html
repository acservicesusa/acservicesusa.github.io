<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Peotone IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
