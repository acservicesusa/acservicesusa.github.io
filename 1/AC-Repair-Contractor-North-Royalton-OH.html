<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
