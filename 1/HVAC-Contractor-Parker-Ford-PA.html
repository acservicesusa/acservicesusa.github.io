<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is integrated.
