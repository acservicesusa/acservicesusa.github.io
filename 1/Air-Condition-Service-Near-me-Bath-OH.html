This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
