<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Colonial Heights Virginia</h3>

Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
