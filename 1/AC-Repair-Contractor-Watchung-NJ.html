However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
