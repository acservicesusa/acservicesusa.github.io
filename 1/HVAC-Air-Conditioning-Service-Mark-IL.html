<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
