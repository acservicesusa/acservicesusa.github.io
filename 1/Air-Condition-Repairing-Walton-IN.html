<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne toxins from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any offered opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
