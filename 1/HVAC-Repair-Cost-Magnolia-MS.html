<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Magnolia MS</h3>
<p>Everyone deal with a range of risks to our health as we tackle our everyday lives. Driving in cars, flying in aircrafts, taking part in recreational activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all posture varying degrees of risk. Some threats are simply inescapable. Some we select to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the method we want. And some are threats we might choose to avoid if we had the chance to make educated choices. Indoor air contamination is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
