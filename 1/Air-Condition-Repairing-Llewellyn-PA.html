<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
