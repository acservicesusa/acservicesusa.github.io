<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
