<p>Information offered in this security guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing slightly over time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
