<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
