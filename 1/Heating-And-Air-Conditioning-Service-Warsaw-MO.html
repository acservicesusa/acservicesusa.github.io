<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain since they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon going into the home. EPA plans to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable methods of lowering the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies further details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
