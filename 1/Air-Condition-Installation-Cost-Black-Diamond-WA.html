<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
