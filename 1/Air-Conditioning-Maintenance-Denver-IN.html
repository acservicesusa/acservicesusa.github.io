<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Denver</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be performed in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
