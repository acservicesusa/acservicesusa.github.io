<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>The most common kind of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly alternative, however newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas heaters can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
