<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is necessary to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions common in the home.<p>
