<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Anderson SC</h3>

After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
