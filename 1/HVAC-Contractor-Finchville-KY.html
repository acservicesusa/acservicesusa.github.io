<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can afford, many Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a terrible, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
