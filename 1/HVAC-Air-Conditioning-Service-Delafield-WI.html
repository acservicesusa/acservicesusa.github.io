<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
