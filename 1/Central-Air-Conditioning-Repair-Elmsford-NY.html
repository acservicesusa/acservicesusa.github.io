<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Elmsford New York</h3>
<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the increase it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

<p>Selecting the ideal size air conditioner is an essential part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to help you with. Here's why buying the ideal size air conditioner matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up losing money and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
