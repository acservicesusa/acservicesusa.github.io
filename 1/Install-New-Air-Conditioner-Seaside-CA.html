<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
