<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Pinckney MI</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
