This indicates it can heat up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the proper replacement.
