<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years.

<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in South Roxana Illinois</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in South Roxana IL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
