<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the very same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
