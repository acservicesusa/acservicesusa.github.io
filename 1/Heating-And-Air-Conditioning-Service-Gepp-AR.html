Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
