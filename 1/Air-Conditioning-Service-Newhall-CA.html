<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
