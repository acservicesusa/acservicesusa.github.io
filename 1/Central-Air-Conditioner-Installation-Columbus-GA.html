<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature stays consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide consistent and trusted heating & cooling.<p>
