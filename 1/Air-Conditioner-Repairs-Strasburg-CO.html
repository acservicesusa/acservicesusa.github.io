This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a better alternative for those who are concerned about security, both in terms of people and the environment, with geothermal services using an environment-friendly energy source for heating and cooling houses.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
