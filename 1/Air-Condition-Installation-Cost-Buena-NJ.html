<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation service completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices doubts because they just partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides additional details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
