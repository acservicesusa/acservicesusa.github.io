<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
