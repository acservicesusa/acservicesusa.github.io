<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet likewise includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.
