<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
