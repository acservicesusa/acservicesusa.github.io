<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
