Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
