<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Leitchfield KY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

The systems works wonderful and the brand-new workplace feels really comfortable. It was a satisfaction working with such an expert company and would highly advise them to anyone looking for HVAC.<p>
