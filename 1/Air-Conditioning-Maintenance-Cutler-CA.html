<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Cutler CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
