<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than numerous heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you buy.

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
