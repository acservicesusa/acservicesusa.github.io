Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
