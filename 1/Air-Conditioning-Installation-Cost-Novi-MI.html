Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
