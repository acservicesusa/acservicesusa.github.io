<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
