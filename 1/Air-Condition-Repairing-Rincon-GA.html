<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, workplaces and schools matters, particularly since we spend most of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity.
