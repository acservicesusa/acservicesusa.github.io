<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations develop up indoors.<p>
