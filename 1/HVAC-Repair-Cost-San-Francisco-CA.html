<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings.

<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological contaminant. Biological impurities in the home might consist of mold, bacteria, infections, termites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness.

Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed.
