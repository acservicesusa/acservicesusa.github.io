<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
