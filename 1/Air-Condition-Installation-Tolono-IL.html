<p>A customized ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
