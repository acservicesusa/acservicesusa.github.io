<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear.

Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
