<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
