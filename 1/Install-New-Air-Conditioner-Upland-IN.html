<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
