<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Omaha AR</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
