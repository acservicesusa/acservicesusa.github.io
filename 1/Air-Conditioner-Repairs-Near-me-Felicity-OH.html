<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
