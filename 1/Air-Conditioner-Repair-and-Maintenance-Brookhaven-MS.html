<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
