<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
