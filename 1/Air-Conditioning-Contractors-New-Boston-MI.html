<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
