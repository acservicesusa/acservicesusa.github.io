What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
