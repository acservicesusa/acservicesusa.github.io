We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We selected getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
