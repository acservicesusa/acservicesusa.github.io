<p>Some health effects might appear soon after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and usually short-term.

<p>There are 2 main types of glowing flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
