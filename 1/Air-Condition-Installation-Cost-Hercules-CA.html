<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively.
