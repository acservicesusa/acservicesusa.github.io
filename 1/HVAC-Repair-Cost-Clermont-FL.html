<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
