<h3>Passive Ventilation in Gheens LA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
