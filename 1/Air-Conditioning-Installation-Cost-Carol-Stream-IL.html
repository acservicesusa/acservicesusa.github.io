<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Heaters are devices whose function is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done through central heating Such a system includes a heat, boiler, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central place such as a furnace room in a house, or a mechanical room in a large building.
