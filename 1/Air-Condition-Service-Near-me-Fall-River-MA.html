<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
