<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at affordable energy costs.

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
