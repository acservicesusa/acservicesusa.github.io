<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration technologies are becoming more typical as readily available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages.

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities.

Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
