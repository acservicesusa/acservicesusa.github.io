<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Basking Ridge NJ</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
