<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden seem greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system. New heating devices is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs immediately, not to mention the cash you'll save on repair expenses. You can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and provide longer long lasting house heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize a problem that will need a significant investment to treat. Then, it's decision time.

The decision to repair or replace is up to you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides greater energy effectiveness and includes guarantee protection.<p>
