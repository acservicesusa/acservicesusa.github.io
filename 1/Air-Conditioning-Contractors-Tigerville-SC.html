<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.
