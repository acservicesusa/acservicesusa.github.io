There are many different locations an obstruction can take place. One of the main locations where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
