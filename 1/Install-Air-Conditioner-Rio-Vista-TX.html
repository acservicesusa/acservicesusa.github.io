<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
