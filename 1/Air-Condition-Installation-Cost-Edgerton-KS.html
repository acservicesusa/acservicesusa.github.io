Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
