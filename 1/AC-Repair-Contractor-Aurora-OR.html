<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Aurora OR</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>When you purchase a brand-new cooling and heating system, you're buying your home, your household, and your business. You are worthy of to know who will show up, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you have actually hired. We hear all the time about questionable automobiles showing up with people who can't communicate well, aren't expert, and leaves you questioning what you simply invested your cash on.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Air Conditioning, we take terrific pride in using simple, classy solutions to the full spectrum of HVAC needs. From heating systems and ac system to indoor air quality systems and peripheral wise accessories, we can offer you with the services and items you need for a system you can rely on all year round. Our goal is to guarantee that our customers are comfortable in their houses at all times - we genuinely appreciate doing what is best for the people who delegate their houses to us.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
