<h3>Air Condition Service in Maypearl TX</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate situation & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Martin said the company is all set to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and anticipates to have a group of about seven to 10 staff members when it opens the doors on the new center by early fall. This consists of present service technicians who represent the company in the market and belong to its general worker base of 800 staffers, with 1,000 employees expected to be on the job for MacDonald-Miller this summertime.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements totally by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you understand it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild results that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
