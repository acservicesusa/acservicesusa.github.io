<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
