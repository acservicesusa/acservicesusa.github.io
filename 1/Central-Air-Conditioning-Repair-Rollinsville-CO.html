Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
