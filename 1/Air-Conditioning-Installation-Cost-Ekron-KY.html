Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.

While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
