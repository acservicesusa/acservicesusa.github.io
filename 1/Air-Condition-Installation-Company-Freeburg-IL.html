Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house.
