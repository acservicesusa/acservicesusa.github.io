<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
