<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this information may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
