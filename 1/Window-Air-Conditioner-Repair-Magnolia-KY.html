<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
