<p>Air conditioning unit manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by checking any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
