<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold.

For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
