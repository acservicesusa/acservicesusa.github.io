<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Hallsboro NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the specialists thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
