Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
