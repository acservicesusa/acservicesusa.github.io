<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
