It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing hot and cold air throughout your house, offering a comfy environment in every room. But ducts that are not installed appropriately or kept can distribute impurities from one room to another. Over time, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, decreasing the total air quality. Work with an expert to make sure your ducts are circulating fresh, clean air.<p>
