<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
