<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem.

The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
