A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
