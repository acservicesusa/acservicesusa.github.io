<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
