It doesn't take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now.
