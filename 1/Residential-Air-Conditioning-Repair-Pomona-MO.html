<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Pomona MO</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
