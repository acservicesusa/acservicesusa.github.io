<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.
