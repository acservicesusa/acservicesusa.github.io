<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the shops vary outside of an appropriate range that might prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and efficiency.

The bright side is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
