<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and offices matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold enjoy wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control.
