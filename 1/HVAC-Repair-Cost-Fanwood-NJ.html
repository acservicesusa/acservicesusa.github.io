<p>Information supplied in this security guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years.

If your house is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.
