<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and informative, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and located ways we might have more even heat.
