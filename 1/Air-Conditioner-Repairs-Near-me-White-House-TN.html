<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
