What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
