<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's development does not necessarily equate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, air and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives, demand heats up throughout the summer and winter.<p>
