<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health concern associated to the indoor environment, please schedule a consultation for a medical evaluation at the University Worker Occupational Health Clinic by calling 919-966-9119.

Please send and complete the form by means of e-mail or fax It is necessary when finishing the demand that you supply as much information as possible for the EHS Responder.<p>
<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
