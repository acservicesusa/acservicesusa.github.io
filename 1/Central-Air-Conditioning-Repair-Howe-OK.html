<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95).

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
