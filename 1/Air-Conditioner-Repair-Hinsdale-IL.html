<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
