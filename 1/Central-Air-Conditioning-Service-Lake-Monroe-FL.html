<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
