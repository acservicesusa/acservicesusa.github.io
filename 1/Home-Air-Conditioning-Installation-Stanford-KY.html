<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Stanford KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
