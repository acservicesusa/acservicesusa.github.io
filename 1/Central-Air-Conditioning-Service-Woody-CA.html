<p>Certain immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to focus on the time and place symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the location, for example, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
