PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
