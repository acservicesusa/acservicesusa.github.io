<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
