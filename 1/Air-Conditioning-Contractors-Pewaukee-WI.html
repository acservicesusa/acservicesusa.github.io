<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most crucial factor affecting indoor air quality is the existence of toxin sources. Frequently discovered workplace toxins and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure products; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from constructing materials, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning activities and products, toilet air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological contaminants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
