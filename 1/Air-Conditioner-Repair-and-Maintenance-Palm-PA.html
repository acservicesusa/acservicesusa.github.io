<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Palm PA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
