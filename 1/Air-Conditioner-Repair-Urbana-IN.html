<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.
