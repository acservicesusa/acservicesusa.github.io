<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet also consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
