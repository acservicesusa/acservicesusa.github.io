Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, tiredness, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific illness have actually been connected to particular air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant signs but can result in cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to supplying a workplace that is free of recognized risks and to examination problems that might be related to poor indoor air quality (IAQ). Though particular regulations have actually not been developed for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health And Wellness Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Health Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air toxins.
