<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
