<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
