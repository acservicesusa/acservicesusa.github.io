<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before.
