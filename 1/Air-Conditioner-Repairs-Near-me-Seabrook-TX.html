<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks.
