The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
