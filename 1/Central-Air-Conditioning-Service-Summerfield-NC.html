<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
