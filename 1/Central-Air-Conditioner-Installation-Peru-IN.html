Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump need to be without all blockages and debris.
