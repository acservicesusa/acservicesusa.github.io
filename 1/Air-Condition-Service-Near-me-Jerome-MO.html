Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Jerome MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
