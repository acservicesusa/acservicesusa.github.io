<h3>Passive Ventilation in Armonk New York</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans must be set up in all restrooms and cooking areas. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are resilient and quiet.
