<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic utilized around the world, consisting of EMV. He's stated several times that the special code function is numerous and optional, many sellers don't use it because it slows down deals a lot more due to the back-and-forth interactions needed.
