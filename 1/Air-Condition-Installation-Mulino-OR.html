<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
