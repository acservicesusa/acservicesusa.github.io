<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
