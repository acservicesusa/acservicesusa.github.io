<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
