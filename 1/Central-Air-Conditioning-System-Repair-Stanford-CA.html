<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Stanford California</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Stanford CA - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

<h3>Boiler Heating System in Stanford CA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
