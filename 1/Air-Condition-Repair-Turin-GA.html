<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
