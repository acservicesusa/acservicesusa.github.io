Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level does not get expensive or too low. In other words, they are ideal for our Seattle climate! They are highly efficient, beating out most other kinds of heating systems in performance.

The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
