<h3>HVAC Company in Woodridge IL</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain since they just partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon going into the home. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trustworthy means of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
