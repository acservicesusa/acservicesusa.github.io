An option to packaged systems is using different indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and commonly used worldwide other than in North America. In North America, divided systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining appeal in small commercial buildings.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on private sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient.
