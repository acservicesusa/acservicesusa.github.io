<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Crozier VA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
