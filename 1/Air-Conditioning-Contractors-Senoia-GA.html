<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day.

He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
