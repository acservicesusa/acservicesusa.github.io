<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Our professionals describe all of your alternatives before beginning the repair, so you can decide whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Rates-- including charging by the task, not by the hour-- suggests the cost we estimate you is the price you pay. If you decide that changing your furnace is the best course of action, we can install a brand-new, high-efficiency model in its location.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only factor for high expenses. Furnaces typically lose their efficiency as they age, especially if they have not been correctly maintained. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to provide the exact same amount of heat. This will cause your energy expenses to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month might be utilized to help you pay for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a significant distinction.<p>

<p>Specific instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution.
