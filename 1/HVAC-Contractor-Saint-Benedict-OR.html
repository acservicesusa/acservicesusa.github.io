<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating.

In some cases, completely brand-new ductwork might require to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your duct examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor.
