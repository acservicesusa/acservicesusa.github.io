<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job may need totally various steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being checked.

In some cases, completely brand-new ductwork might require to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your duct examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor.
