<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The most typical kind of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive choice, however newer systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly efficient natural gas furnaces can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
