<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Laveen AZ</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
