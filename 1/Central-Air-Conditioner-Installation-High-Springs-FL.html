<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
