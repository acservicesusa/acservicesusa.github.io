<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Onyx CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
