<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
