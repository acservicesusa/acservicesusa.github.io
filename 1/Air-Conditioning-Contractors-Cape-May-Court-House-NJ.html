<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
