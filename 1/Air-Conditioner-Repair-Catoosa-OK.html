After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
