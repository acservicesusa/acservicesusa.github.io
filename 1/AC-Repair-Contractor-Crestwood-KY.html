<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself offered - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these devices). I have nothing but excellent things to say - he has taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - fast resolution.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
