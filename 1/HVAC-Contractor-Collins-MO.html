<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Collins MO</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is dirty or clogged Prior to trying to fix any problem, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Clogged rain gutters can result in water permeating into the house, causing mold growth, according to the EPA.

Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
