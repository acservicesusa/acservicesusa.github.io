<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Cleveland MO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170.
