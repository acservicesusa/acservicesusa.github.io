<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, cigarette smoking, home items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
