<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
