<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Stone Mountain GA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process.

Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
