<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures continuously develop as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing slightly gradually as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious.

Children, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids may have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
