Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
