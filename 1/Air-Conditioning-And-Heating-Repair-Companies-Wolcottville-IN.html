Such information can often be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs.
