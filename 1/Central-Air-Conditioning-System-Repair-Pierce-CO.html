<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
