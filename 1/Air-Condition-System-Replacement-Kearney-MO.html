This is typically used in a third-floor or second area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
