<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
