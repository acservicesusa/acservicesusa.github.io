<p>Oil furnaces are usually not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve an efficiency greater than 90%.

<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
