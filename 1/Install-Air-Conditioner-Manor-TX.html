<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off.

Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
