<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is protected indoors. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. Most of samples evaluated were evaluated favorable for fungi and bacteria.<p>
