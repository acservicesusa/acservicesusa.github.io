<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the really low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will just run more difficult to keep a warm climate for your home when the weather condition is exceptionally cold.

<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters obstructed with dust, pet hair and other debris lead to problems like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.
