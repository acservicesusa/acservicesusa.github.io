<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
