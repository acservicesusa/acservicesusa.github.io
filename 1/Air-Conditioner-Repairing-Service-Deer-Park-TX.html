<p>Your concerns or concerns about indoor air problems can often be responded to by the federal government agencies in your state or local government. Duties for indoor air quality issues are generally divided among several firms. Calling or writing the agencies accountable for health or air quality control is the best method to begin getting info from your state or city government. To acquire state company contacts, compose or call EPA's IAQ Info Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally include lead. Water typically gets lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development does not always translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The air, heating and ventilation conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When clients require their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives, need heats up during the summer and winter.<p>
