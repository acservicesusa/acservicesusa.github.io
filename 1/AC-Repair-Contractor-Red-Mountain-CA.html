<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances.

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
