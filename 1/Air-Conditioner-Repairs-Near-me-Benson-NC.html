<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.
