<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. Only be concerned if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a professional to inspect and repair the unit.<p>
