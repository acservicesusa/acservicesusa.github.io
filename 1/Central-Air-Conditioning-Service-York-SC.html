<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.
