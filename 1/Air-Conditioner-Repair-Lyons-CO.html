<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Lyons CO</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
