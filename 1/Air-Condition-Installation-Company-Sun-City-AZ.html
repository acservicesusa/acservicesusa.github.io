<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly appear greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair expenses. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
