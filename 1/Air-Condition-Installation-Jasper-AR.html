<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit.
