Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity.

A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Glendale SC</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
