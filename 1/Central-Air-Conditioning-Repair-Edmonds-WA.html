<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home.

Your heating unit will strive for you, but like your vehicle, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running efficiently, avoid issues, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
