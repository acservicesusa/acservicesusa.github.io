<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in San Marcos TX</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
