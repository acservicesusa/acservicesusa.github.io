<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
