<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to set up, particularly if you make it part of a develop or restoration job. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat option can be installed as a Do It Yourself task as it is basic to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, ready to be presented in place. Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
