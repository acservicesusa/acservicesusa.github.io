<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.

No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact.

We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
