<p>A matched system is the mix of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending on your region, a matched system can be composed of the following: an a/c and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heat pump and air handler, an air conditioning system and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Similar to most home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based on the size of the home. Many heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years.

A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
