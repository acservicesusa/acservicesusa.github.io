<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
