<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
