When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
