Such a tool ought to recognize the variety of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or health problems; recognize all machines run in the workplace; show the kind of outside air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of job stress.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results discussed.
