<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>In addition, property owners have a range of choices to select from in powering a floor heating system. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
