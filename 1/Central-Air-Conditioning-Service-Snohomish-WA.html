<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Snohomish WA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
