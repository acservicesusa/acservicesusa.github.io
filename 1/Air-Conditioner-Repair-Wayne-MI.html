<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes.
