<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
