We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge houses.
