<h3>Which Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Southport NC?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven.

Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
