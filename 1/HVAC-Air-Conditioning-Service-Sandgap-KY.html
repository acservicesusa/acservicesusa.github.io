<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be set up to provide threshold signals. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the circumstance instantly.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
