<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Discovery Bay CA Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it progressively challenging for your lungs to operate properly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
