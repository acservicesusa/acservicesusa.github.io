Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).
