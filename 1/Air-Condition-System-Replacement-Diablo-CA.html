<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are just not possible. Maybe your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler just can't be repaired. Whatever the case, specific circumstances require full-blown heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have been assisting house owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their homes' heating systems when their old ones are no longer practical.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
