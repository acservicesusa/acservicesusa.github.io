<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a team that regularly monitors energy intake and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that might prevent consumers from shopping at the store.<p>

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often tough to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
