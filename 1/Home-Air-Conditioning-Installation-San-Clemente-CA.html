<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
