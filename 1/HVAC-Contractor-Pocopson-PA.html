<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
