<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
