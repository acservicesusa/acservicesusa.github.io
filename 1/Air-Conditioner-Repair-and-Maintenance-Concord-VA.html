<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
