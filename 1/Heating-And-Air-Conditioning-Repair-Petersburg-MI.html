<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure.
