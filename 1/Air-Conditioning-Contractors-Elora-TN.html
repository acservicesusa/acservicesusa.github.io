<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
