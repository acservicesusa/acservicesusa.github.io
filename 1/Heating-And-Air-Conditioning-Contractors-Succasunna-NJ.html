<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
