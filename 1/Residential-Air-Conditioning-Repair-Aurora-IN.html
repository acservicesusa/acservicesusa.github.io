<p>Many commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer service at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
