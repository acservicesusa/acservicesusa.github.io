<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
