<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
