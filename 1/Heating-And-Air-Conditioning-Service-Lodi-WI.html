<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
