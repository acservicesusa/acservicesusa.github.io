My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control.

Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
