<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
