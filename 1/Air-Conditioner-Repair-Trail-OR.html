<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
