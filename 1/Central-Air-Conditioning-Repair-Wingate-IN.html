<p>Homeowners might also assume that since a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or adversely impacts residential or commercial property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Magazine. Perhaps Real estate agents should think about a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking cost.
