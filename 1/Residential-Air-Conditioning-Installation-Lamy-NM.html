<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results mentioned. However, it is not always true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results could take place.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
