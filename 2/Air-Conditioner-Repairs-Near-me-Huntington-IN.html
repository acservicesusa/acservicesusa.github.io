<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.)

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this information may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
