<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
