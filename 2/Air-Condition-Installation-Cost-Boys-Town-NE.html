<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
