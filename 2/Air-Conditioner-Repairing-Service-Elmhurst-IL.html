<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
