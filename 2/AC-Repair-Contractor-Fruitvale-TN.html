<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

The outdoor unit should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively released outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop greatly. It is highly suggested to install the a/c unit units in quickly accessible places, for further maintenance throughout operation.<p>
