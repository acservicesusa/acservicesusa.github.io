<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
