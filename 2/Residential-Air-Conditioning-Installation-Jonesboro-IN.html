<h3>How to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Jonesboro IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems must be checked a minimum of two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
