<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Many people do not understand that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break gradually. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and eventually harm it enough that you need to buy furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully analyze the connections and assess the performance of the system. They'll look for torn and harmed wires and replace them in order to reduce the threat of fire and element failure.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and available source of energy.<p>
