<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
