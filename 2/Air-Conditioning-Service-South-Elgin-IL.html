<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
