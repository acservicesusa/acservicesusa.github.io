<h3>Furnace Cost in Lockwood California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part.

This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
