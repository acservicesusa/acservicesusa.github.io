<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure.

<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
