They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My spouse stated that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time.
