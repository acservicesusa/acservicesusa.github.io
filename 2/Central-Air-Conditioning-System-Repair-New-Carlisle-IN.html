If a company makes every effort to do right by the customer every day, weekly, it will show in their reviews. See what current consumers need to state. Are the technicians prompt?

<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
