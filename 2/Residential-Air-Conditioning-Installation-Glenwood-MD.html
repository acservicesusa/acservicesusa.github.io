<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Glenwood MD</h3>
<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
