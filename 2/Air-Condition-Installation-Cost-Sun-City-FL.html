<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Sun City FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
