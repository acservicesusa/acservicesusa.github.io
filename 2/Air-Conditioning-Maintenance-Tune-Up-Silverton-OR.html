<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however lots of utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option.

Evaluation of this information might recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
