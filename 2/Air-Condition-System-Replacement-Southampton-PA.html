<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise technology. Martin stated the company can establish a control panel within the building's controls that will offer information on its systems to enable actual time exposure, providing the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial client, not simply during brand-new building.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
