<p>Expert heater installations. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies supply opportunities they can't accomplish by themselves. Many owners stay with the larger firms after acquisition. Sometimes, the acquisition provides a method for the seller to retire and make certain employees are looked after.

Reedy chooses the owners stay on and reinvest a portion of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
