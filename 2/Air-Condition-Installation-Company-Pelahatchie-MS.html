<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

He likewise reacted to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to an issue that couldn't be fixed on the very first see due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
