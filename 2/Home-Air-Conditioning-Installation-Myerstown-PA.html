<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
