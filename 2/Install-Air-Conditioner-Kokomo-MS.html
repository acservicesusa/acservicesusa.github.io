<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to understand.<p>
