<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Sandston VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
