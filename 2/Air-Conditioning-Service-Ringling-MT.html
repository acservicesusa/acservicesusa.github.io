<p>Your concerns or issues about indoor air problems can frequently be answered by the government companies in your state or city government. Obligations for indoor air quality issues are generally divided among several companies. Calling or writing the companies responsible for health or air quality control is the best way to start getting information from your state or local government. To acquire state company contacts, call or compose EPA's IAQ Info Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. location.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not generally contain lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the house from household pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
