<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
