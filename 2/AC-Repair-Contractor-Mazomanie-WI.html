<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
