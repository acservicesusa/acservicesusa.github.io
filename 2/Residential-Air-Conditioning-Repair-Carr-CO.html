<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>For instance, issues arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Carr CO</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Ac system service consultations include a long list of checks in, on and around your equipment. Knoechel Heating Company specialists will take a look at things that might be making your AC run inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge.
