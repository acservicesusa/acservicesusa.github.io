<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Hillburn NY</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
