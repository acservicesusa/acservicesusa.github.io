<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be warmed properly and the system will need to constantly run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
