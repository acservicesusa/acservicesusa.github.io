<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
