<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractors in Tamassee</h2>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
