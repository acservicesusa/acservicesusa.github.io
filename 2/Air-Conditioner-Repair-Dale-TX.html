AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
