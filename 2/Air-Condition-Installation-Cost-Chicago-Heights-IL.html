They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
