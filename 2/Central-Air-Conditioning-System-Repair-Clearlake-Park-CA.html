<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Clearlake Park CA Home</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
