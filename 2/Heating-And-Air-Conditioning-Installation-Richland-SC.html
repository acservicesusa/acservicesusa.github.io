<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
