<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system too soon, prior to the mortar has actually treated, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the compound had cured. And mortar makers may decline warranty protection if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
