<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks.
