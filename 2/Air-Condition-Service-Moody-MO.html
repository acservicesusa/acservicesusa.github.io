<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
