<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
