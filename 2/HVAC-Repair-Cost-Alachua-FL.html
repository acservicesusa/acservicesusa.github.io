During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.

<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Alachua FL</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside.
