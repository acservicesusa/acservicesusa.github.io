<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.
