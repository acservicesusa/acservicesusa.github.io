<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. Another aspect of the job is recommending clients as to how to avoid future problems and properly preserve equipment by, for instance, frequently oiling parts or altering filters.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be done in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
