<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some illness such as asthma might show up, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
<p>There are a number of non-profit organizations that license indoor air quality experts. Although DEP can not suggest the services of any specific person or company, choosing a professional that has actually gotten the proper training and accreditation should help guarantee you receive quality services. When choosing an indoor air quality professional, it is very important to compare the services (and costs) of different experts, examine references, etc. just as you would for any other service or product.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
