I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
