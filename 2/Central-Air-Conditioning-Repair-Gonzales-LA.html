<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers.
