<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
