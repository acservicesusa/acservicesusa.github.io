<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
