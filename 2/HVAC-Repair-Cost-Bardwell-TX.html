<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
