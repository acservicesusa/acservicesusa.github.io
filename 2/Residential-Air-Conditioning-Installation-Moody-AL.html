<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
