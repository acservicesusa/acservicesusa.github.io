<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and medical facilities, vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
