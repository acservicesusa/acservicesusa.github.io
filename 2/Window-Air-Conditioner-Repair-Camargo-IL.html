<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from task sites.<p>
