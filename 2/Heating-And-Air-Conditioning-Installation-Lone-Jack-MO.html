<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Lone Jack MO - Reasons Why You Would Need to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
