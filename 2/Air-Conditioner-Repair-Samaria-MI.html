<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furniture and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified structure materials, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, however much of the risk also originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>CARB is actively associated with the development of green building standards and indoor air quality standards. CARBOHYDRATE also manages indoor air cleaners so that customers can be guaranteed of their security. CARBOHYDRATE also sponsors and conducts research study into all aspects of indoor air quality, with a concentrate on figuring out levels of exposure to hazardous indoor air toxins, and seeking ways to prevent and reduce that exposure.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality problem is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated issues-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies below may be appropriate.<p>
