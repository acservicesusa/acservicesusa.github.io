<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be efficiently recognized or fixed without a thorough structure investigation. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building investigators examine the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these queries may quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
