<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Grafton WI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
