<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
