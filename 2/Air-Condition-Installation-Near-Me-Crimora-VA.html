<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My better half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a very long time.
