<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
