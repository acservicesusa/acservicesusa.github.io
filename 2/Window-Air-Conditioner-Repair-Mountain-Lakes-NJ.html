Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you need to call in a professional to check and repair the unit.<p>

<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
