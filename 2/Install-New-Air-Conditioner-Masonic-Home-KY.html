<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.
