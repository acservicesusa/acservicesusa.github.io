Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
