<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
