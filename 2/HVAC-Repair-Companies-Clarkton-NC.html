<h3>AC Technician in Clarkton NC</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
