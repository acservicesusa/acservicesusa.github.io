Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
