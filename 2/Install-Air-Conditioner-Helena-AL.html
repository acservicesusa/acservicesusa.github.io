<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power.

Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
