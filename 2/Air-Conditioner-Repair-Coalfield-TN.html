<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
