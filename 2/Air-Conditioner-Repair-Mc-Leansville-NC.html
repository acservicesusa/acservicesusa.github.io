All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.
