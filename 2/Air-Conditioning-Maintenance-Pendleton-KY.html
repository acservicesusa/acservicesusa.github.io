Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
