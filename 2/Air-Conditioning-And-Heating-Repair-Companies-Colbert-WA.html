<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not an option.
