<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
