The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify problems.
