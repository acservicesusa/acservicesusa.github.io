<p>Structures are developed or intended to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surface areas to boost their look, durability, or efficiency. In other cases, such changes subtly and even dramatically alter structures in manner ins which might be essential to their own integrity or their impact on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our structures.<p>
