<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
