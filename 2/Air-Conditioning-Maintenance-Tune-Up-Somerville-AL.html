<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them again.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For Your Project in Somerville AL</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
