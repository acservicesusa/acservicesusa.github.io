<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
