According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts.
