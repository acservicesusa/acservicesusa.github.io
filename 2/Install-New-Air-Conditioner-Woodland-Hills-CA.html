<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
