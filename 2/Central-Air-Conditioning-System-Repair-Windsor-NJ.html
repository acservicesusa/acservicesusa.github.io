HVAC experts recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>
