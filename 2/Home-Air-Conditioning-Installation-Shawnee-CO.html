I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.
