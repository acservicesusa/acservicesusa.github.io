<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
