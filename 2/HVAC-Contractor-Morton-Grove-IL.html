<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
