<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
