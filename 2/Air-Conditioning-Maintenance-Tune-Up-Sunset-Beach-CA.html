<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Sunset Beach CA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
