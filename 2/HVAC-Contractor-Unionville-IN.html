<h3>Gas Central Heating in Unionville IN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
