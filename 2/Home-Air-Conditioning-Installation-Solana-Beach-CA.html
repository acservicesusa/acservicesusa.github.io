<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response data which show the health impacts of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical. Similar information is not available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a combination of impurities as holds true for IAQ problems. Presently, there is inadequate info readily available to forecast the impacts of direct exposure to a number of possibly hazardous agents at the very same time.<p>
