<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental problems.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
