<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
