<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
