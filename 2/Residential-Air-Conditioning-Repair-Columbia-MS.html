<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
