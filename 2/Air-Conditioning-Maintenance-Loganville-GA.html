<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly seem higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
