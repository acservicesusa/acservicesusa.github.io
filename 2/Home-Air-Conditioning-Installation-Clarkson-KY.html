<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
