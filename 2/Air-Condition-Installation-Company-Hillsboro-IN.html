<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.
