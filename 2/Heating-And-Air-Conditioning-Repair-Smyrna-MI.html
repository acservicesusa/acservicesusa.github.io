<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
