<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Workplace temperatures ought to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation ought to be prevented.<p>
