This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
