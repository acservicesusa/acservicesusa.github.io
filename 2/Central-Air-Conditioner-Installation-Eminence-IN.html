<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Eminence IN</h3>
<p>Radiant heat systems are progressively popular, particularly in the previous quarter-century as technology has actually advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in reliability and economy. Unlike convection heating, radiant heat systems have no ductwork and no air flow. Radiant systems depend on heat transfer by the infrared clinical principle used by the sun called line of vision." These undetectable electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In an included system like a home, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is attained.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
