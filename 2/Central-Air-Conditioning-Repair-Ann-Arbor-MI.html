<p>All homes need reliable ventilation.

Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard.

Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
