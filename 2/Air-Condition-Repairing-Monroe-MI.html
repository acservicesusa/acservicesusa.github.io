<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When deciding which of the best AC systems they must install in their houses, there are a few main things that homeowners will desire to take into factor to consider. It really depends upon what you value the most in a top brand central air conditioner. The significant aspects for most homeowners will be the total cost to install the best a/c unit brand names, life expectancy of the AC system, guarantees provided, energy effectiveness (SEER scores), and size of the unit you need for your house's square video (LOADS) to effectively cool your home.<p>
