<p>A homeowner can effectively learn to do a task such as bleeding and restarting an oil furnace, but you must be confident that you know what you're doing. People who are experienced with such do-it-yourself tasks will probably be able to bleed the furnace without too much of a problem.

<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services provided.
