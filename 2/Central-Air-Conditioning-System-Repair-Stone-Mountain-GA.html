<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Stone Mountain GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Given that 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Advancement (HUD) has actually permitted only using plywood and particleboard that conform to defined formaldehyde emission limitations in the building and construction of upraised and mobile homes. In the past, some of these houses had raised levels of formaldehyde because of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used in their building and construction and because of their reasonably small interior area.<p>
