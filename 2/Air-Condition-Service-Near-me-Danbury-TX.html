<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but lots of use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
