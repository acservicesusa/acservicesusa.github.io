To make certain the unit you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not just replace it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
