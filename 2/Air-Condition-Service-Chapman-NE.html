<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Chapman NE Home Owners</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can include certain health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you just can't seem to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heating unit are not vulnerable to this concern. Furthermore, given that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heating unit can decrease the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
