<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Consequently, the most reliable way to minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking cigarettes there.<p>
