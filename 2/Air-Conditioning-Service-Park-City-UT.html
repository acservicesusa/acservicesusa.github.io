<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health effects mentioned.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
