<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
