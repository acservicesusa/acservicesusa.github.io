Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
