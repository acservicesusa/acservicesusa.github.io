<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
