The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems must be inspected a minimum of two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
