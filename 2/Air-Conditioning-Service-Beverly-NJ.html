<p>Buildings are developed or meant to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to improve their longevity, look, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even significantly modify buildings in ways that may be very important to their own integrity or their impact on structure residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the methods used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation.
