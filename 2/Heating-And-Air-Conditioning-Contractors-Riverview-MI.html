<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
