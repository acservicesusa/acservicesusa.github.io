<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a simple and effective  technique to reduce ambient air contamination and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about potential effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
