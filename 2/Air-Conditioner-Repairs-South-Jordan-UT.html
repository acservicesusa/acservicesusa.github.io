<h3>AC Maintenance in South Jordan Utah</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While many people assume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician requires to inspect the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the entire HVAC system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly.
