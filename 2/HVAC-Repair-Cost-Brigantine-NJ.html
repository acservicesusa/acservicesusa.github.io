<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which typically consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
