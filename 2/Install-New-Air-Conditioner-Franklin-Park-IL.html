<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Franklin Park IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue.

The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
