<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
