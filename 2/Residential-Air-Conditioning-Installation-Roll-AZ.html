Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
