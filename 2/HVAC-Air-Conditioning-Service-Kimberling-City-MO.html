<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Often it's not a significant issue, and your system may merely need some maintenance work. It is surprising the number of of us practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles, for example, but don't do the exact same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter. Do not hesitate to ask about our service plans that include preventive maintenance if you want to stay ahead of any problems with your home or company HVAC system, so you can avoid costly repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can normally be done in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
