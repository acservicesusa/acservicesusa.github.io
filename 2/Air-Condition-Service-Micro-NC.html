<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
