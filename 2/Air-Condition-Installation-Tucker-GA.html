Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
