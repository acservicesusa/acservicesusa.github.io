<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>

Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>
