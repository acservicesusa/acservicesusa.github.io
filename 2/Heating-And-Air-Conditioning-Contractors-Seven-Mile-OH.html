<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
