<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
