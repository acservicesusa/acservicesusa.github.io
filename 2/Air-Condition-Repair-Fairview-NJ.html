Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
