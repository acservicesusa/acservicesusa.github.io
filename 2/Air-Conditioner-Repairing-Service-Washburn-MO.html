<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
