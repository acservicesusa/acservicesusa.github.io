<h3>AC Replacement Service in Coal City IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
