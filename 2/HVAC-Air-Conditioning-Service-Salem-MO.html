This is a lot more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them..
