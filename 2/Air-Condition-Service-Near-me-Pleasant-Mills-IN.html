Combustion items from automobile exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heating units, aromatic candles, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
