We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioner stops working, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
