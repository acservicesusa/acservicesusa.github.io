<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big retailer who asked not to be called since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save on expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an appropriate variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally require excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
