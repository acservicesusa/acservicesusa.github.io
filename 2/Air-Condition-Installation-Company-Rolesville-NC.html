Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day.
