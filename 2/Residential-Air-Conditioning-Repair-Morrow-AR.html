<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Morrow AR?</h3>

<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
