<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
