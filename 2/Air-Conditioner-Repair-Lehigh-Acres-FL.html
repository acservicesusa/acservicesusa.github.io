<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not.
