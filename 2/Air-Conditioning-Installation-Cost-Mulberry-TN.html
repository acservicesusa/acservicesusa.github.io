<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
