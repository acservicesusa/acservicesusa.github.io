<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
