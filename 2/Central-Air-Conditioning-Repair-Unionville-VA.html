When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Preventive maintenance gives you the comfort that your A/c and Heating unit are working efficiently and effectively.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensor changed as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
