<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced.

A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
