<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
