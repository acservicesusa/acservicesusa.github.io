<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Nesbit MS</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
