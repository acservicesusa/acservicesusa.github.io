<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heatpump work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical power, a heat pump is an affordable service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study contacted several duct-cleaning services.
