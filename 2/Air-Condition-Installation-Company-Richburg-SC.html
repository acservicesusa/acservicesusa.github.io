<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Richburg SC Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Air Conditioning is HVAC Contractor offering the best possible Heating and A/c Repair, maintenance and installation for your house or organisation in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Isle of Palms South Carolina. You can count on us to offer you with a system and solution that fits your special requirements and since we have actually set up many systems in this location, we have actually earned a credibility for doing the job right the first time.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
