<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units feature a number of unique features that can further enhance performance and efficiency. For instance, property owners may want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to lower energy costs much more. Of course, more features mean higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
