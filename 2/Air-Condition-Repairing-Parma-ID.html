However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

The impacts of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
