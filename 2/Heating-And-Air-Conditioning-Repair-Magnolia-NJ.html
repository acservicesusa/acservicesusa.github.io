<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Magnolia NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
