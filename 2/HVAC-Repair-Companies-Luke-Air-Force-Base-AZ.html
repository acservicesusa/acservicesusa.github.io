<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
