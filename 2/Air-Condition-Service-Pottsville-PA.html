<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
