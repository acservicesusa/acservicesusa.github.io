<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.

He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
