<h3>Ductwork Installation in Paradise Valley Arizona</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are related to direct exposure to contaminants from bacteria that can grow in large structure ventilation systems.

<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to figure out if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific requirement.
