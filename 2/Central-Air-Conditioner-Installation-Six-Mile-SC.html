<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
