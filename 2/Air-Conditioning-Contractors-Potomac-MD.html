<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same).
