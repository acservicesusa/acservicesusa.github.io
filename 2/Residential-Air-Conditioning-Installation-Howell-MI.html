Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
