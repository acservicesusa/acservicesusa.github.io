<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
