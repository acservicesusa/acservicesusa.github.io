<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
