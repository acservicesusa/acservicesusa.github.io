<p>The bureau projects 34 percent work development for HVAC professionals between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. A number of elements add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older air conditioning systems to satisfy stricter ecological regulations. The slow rebound in residential and commercial construction will produce a steady flow of brand-new opportunities, particularly for professionals who are willing to relocate.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
