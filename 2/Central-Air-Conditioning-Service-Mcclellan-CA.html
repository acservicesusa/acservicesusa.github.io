<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
