<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
