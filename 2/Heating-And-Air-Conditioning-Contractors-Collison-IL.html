<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
