<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply glowing systems.

EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
