While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps should also be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals need to be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can manage, many Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens.

<p>Occupants of houses with bad indoor air quality might experience signs such as headache, eye irritation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus lightheadedness, congestion, and queasiness.
