<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and must be disposed of. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
