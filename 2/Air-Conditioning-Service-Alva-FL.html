<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, consider prospective impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's directions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
