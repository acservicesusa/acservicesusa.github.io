They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
