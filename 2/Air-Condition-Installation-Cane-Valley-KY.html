<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
