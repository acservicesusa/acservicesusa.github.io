<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
