<p>The heat pump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate climates, but with enhancements in low temperature operation and decreased loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Assessment Methodology (GROUP) studies found levels of about a dozen typical natural pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, despite whether the homes were located in highly industrial or rural locations. Additional GROUP research studies show that while individuals are utilizing products consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high toxin levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
