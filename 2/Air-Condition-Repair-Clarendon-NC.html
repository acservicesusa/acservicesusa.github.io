<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>These guys have been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Recently I needed to contact these guys twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good idea to think of energy performance. By picking a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run. Efficiency ratings need to be identified with all systems. While effective systems might cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated appliance is a fantastic method to take pleasure in extra comfort.<p>
