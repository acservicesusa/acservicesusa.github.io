<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; flooring, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger only when they are handled in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for considerable illness.<p>
