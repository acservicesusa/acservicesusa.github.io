<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
