<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems.

<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company.

Some companies offer top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
