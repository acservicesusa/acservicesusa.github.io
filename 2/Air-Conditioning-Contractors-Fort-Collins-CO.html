<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, particularly given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely damp climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are less common now than gas, but they can be useful in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in chillier environments since it supplies more heat per BTU than other solutions.

They require a storage tank on the instant property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they offer an AFUE ranking of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0.
