<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
