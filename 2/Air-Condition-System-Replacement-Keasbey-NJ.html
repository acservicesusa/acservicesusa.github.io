<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a harsh, terrible summertime.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
