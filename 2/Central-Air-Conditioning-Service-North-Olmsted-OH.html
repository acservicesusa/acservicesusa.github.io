<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance gos to per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other perks. Some companies provide priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
