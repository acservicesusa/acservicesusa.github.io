<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
