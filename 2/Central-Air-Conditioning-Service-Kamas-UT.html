<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
