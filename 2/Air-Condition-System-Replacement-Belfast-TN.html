<h3>Heating Contractors in Belfast Tennessee</h3>

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
