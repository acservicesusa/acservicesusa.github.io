<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
