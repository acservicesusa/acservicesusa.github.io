<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioner will not have the ability to cool the house appropriately. These are just a few of the elements that you require to consider when buying a new AC system. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
