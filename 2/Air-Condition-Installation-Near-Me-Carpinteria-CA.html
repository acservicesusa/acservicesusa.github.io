<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Carpinteria CA?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
