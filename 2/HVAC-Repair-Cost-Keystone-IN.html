<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Keystone IN?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a service or seller to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee won't do you any great ought to the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the start and employ a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
