<p>HVAC coils usually offer you a good 15-20 years of life before they begin establishing refrigerant leaks. Refrigerant leaks aren't the only problem cooling coils have.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
