<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
