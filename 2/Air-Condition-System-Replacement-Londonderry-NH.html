<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
