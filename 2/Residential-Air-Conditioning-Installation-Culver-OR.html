For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
