<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in South Lyon</h2>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can mean substantial savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
