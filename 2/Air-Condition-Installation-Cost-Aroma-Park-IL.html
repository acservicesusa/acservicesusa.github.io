<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, pet hair and other particles result in issues like failure to offer adequate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement options variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. That might be a very pricey dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This kind of cleaning work need to be performed in a routine basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
