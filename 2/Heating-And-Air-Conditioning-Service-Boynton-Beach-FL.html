<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
