<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Bringhurst IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be inspected a minimum of twice each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
