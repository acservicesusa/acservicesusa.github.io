<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, consider possible effects of indoor air contamination.
