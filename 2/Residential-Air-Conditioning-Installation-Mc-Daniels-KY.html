<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house.
