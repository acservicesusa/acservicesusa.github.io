<p>Let's start by detailing the planning that needs to occur before you in fact buy a furnace. Choosing a furnace for your home isn't as basic as selecting one off a display room flooring. Not all furnaces are good for all houses, and there are a couple of aspects that definitely need to be thought about before choosing one. First, you'll need one that is effectively sized for your house. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to handle, and will cause problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to supply adequate heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
