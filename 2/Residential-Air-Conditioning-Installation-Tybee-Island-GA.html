<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your house likewise depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective. Central air systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most cost-effective option.<p>
