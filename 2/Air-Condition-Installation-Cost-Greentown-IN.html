<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.
