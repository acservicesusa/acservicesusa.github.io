<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Pattison MS</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Due to the fact that they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unsure. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reputable means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides additional info on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
