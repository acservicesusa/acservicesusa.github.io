Ventilation, a typical approach of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will lower but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to significantly lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. Subsequently, the most effective way to lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
