<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

This should do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>

However, presuming they are set up properly and properly looked after, the probability of them having problems is small.<p>
