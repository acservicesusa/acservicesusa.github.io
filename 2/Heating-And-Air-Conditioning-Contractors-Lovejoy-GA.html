<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
