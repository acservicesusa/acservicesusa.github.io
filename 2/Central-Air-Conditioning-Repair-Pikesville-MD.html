All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
