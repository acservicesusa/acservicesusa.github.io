Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
