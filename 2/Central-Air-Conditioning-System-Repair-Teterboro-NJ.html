<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Teterboro NJ</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the ac system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
