<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be linked to a gadget called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heat pump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This suggests that this device can also offer complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
