<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
