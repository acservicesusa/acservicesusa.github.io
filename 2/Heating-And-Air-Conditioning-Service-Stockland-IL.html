<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental expenses.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heater that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, because it is secured inside your home.
