The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
