<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Hillsborough NH</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the different homes they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), correct filtration, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is operating safely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
