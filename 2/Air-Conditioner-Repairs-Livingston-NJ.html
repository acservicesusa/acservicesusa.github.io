<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided.

If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
