<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
