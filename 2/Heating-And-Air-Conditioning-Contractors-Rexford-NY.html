<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
