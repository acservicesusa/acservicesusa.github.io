<p>You might update to the highest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
