<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
