<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
