Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
