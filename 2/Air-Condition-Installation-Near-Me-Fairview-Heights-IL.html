<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision.
