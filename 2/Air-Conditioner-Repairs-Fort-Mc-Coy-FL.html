<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burnt.

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
