<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are typically smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use considerably less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat. Anticipate the typical mobile house oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as many brand names produce oil heaters for this usage, and you might discover more options with natural gas, propane, or electric heating systems.<p>
