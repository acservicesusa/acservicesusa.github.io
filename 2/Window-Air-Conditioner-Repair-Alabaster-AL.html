<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
