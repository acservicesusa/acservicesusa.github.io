<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
