<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
