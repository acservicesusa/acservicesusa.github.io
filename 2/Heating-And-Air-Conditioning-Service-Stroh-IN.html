Stagnant air may also be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to represent an increase in the number of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
