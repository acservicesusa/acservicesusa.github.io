<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention.
