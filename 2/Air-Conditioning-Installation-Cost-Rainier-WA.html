<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
