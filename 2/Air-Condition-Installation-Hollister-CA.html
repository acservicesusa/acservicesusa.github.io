Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
