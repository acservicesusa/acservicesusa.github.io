The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
