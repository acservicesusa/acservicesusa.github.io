<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and reliable  technique to decrease ambient air contamination and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
