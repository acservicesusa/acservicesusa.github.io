The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness with time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
