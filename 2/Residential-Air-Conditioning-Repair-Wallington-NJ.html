<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable.

<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use contracts.. The so called trusted companies swindle more people than the fly by night clothing.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
