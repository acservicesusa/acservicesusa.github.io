<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heater) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Lloyd FL</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is essential to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for accuracy and the burners are adjusted for optimal effectiveness. Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the useless 'eyeball the flame' approach that other companies use. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by determining the exhaust gasses and making scientific modifications. This alone might spend for the whole maintenance check out at today's cost of gas.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our choices did an excellent job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The specialists who set up the new system were expert and quick, while taking some time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
