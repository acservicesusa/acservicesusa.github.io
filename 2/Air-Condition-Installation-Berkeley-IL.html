<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
