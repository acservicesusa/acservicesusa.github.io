<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>A third method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To find smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
