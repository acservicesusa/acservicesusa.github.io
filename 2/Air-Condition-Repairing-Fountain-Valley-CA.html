<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Fountain Valley CA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
