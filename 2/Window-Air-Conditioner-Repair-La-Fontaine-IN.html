<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
