Air pressure distinctions produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Property owners may also assume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth.

Possibly Realtors must think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may add to, or subtract from, any provided asking price. That said, homebuyers looking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
