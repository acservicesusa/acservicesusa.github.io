<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
