<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and last floor finish. This is generally used in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
