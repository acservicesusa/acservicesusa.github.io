<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
