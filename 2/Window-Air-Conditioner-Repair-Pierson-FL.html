<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
