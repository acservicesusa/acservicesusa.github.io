<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, triggering your new under tile floor heater too soon, before the mortar has cured, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere correctly, and may void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the compound had actually treated. And mortar makers may refuse service warranty coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
