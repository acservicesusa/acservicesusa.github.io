<h3>Facts All Carson CA Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
