<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Mount Hamilton CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
