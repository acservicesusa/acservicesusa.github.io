<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an a/c system to install in their lunar electric rover. They decided they needed expert help and consulted many suppliers. Lastly, after a rigorous selection procedure, the space company selected Dometic. We've had a great deal of firsts throughout the years, however this customized job presented unique difficulties for our engineers," said a spokesperson for Dometic.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
