<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
