<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
