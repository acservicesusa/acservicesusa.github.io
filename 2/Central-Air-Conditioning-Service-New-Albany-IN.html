In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
