<p>Compounding the noted health symptoms might be job stress. In part, due to different elements of workplace automation, the most demanding aspects of workplace work are increasing. Health signs related to job stress include physical and mental stress such as frustration, stress and anxiety, irritation, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental stress. These signs might be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
