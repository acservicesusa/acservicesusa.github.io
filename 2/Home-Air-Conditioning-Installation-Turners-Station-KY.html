<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
