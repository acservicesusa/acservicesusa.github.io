<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Whatever heater you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home won't be heated up effectively and the system will need to constantly go to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
