<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Haddonfield NJ</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
