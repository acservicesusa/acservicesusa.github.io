Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of areas at Target and other leading sellers.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
