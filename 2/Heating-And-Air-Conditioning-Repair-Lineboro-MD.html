<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
