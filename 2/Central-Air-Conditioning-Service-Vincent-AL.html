<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Vincent AL</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's challenging, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be used in one or several spaces like bathrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric glowing flooring heat. This is far more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may be suitable for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
