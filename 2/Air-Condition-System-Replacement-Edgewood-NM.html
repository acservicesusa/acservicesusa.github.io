<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
