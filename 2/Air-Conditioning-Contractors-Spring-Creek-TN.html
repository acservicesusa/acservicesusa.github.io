<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
