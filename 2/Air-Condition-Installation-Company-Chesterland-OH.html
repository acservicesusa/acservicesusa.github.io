<p>Expert heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new.
