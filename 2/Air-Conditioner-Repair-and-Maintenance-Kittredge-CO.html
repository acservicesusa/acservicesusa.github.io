<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
