<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your North Palm Springs CA Home</h3>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered.
