<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
