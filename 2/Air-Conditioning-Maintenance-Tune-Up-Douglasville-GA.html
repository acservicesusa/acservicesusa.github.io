<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
