<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to greater energy costs. High-efficiency designs cost more, but save more over the long haul. Rates for gas heaters range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps usually need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
