<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
