Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
