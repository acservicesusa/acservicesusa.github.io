<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
