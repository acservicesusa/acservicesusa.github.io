<p>A health survey need to be developed and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool needs to recognize the variety of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of particular health signs or diseases; determine all makers operated in the office; indicate the kind of outside air contamination; and determine possible sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
