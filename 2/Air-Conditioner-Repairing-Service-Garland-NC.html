Pushed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
