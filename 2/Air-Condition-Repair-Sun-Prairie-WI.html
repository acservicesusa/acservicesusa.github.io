<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have handled the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and professional.

<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are pointed out here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>
<h3>Furnace Service in Sun Prairie Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
