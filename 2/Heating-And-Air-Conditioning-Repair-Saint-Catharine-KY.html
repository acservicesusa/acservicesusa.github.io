<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
