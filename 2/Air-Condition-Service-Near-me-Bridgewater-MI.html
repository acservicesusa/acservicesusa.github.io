<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summers.

<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are pointed out here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne toxins from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
