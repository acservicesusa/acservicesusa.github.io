<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
