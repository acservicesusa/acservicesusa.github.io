<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result.

Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
