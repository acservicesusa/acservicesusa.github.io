<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
