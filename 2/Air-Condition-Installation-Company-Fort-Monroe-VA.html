The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, up until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
