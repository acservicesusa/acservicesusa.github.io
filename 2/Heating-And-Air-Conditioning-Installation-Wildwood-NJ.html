<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in integrating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you select for your home.

<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations utilize dose-response information which reveal the health effects of repeated direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar data is not offered for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ issues.
