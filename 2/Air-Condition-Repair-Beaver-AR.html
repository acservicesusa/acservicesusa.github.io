<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
