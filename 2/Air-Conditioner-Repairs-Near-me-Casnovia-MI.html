Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking cigarettes, family items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made products. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources.
