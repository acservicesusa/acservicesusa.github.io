<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.  The so called trustworthy companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits. Because I tried to work for them, I know. I quit due to the fact that 90% of them are crooks. They stroll in with or without an agreement and begin offering you things you do not need. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to validate the so called remedies and problems. 9 out of 10, I examine are entirely incorrect.<p>
