<p>Radiant heating systems don't utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also do not create cold and hot spots. All of the heat that radiant heat systems distribute moves through strong items, keeping the heat near the floor of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat spaces with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, since the majority of floorings tend to maintain heat much better than air does.<p>
