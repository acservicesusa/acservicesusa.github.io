<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead.
