<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Pittsboro IN Home</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to work appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
