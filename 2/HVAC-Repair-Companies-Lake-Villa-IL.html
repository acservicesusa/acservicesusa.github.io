<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and very large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement expenses in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
