<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Space a/c feature a thermostat sensor, located behind the control panel, which determines the temperature of air entering the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle continuously or behave erratically if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensor must be near the coil however not touching it; change its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
