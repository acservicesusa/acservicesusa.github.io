<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
