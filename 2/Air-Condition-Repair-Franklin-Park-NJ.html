<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales man concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
