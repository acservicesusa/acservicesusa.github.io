<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.
