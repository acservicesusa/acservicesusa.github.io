<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is connected with a greater frequency of occupant respiratory issues.<p>

A more energy efficient house will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, however it will significantly enhance the comfort of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise several competent home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
