<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building."

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
