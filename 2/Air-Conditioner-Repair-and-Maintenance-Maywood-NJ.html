<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, vicious summertime.<p>
