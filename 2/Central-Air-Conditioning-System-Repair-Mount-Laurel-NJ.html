<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
