<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; floor, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>

The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
