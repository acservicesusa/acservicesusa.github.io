<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
