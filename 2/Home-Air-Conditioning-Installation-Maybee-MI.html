<h3>Choosing the Proper Company For Heating and AC Systems in Maybee MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
