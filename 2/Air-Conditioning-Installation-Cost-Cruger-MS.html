<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater.
