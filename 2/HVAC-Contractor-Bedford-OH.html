<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
