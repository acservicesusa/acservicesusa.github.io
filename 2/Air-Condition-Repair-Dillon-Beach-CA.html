<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
