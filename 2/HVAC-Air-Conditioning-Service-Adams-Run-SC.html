The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Adams Run SC Home</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
