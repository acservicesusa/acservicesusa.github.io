<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Discovery Bay CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
