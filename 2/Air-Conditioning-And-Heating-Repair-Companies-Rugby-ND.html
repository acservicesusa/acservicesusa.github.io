The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Producers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new basic goes into effect.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
