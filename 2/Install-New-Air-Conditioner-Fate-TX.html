<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Fate TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
