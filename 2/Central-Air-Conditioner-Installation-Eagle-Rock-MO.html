<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal effectiveness and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work more difficult and may get too hot if the system is too little. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
