<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one reaction specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
