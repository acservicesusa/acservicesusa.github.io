<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
