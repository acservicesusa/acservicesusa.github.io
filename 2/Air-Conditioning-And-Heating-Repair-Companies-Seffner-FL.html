<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and effectiveness if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
