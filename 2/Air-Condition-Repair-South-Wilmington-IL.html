<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these minor but considerable changes in his quote. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
