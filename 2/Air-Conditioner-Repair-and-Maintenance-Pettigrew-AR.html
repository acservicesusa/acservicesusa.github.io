<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
