<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
