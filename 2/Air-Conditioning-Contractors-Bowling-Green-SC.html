<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room.
