<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners need to be alert to the emergence of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization steps should not be undertaken up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an a/c system to install in their lunar electric rover. They chose they required expert help and spoke with numerous suppliers. Lastly, after an extensive selection process, the area company selected Dometic.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
