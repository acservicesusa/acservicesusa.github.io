Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the essential electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last job is to test the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any problems or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where proper.<p>
