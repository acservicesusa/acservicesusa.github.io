<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
