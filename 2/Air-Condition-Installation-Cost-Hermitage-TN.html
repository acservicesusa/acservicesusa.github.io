<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
