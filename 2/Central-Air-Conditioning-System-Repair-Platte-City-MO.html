<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality.

Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating items.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet.
