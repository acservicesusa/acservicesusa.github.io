<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat.

EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not harmful, but might end up being harmful if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
