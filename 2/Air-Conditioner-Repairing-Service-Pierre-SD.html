<h3>Furnace Cost in Pierre SD</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that the SEER ranking is computed utilizing the exact same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summer season temperature level to reach the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
