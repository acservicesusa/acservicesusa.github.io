<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
