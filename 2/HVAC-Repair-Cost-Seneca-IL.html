<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Seneca IL?</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally happen. In most cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
