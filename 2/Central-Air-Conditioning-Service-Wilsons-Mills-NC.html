<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
