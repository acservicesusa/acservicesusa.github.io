<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
