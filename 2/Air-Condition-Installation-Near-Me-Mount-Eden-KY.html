<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
