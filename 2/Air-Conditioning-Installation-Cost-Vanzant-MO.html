<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
