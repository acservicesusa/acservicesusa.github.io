<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are connected with direct exposure to contaminants from microorganisms that can grow in large structure ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderly people, and individuals with breathing issues, allergic reactions, and lung diseases are particularly vulnerable to disease-causing biological representatives in the indoor air.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

When the air conditioning system works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
