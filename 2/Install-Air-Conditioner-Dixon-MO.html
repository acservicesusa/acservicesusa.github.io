<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
