<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
