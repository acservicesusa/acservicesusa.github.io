<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
