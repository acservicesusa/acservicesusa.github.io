<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.
