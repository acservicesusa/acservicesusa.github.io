<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
