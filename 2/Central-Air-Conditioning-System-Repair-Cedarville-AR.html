<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
