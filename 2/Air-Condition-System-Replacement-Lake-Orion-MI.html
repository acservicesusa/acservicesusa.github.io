<h3>AC Technician in Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
