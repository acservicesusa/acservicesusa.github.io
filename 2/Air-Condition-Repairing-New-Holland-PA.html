<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
