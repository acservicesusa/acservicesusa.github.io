<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have.
