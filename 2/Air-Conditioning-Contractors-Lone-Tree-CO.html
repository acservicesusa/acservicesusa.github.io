<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
