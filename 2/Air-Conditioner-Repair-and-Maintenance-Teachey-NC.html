<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
