The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations).

No additional charge.<p>
