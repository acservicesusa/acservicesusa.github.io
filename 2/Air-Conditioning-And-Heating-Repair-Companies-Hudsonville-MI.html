<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Hudsonville Michigan</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is an extremely common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensor changed as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
