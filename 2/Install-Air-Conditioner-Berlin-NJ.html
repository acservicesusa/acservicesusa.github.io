<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be appropriate.<p>
