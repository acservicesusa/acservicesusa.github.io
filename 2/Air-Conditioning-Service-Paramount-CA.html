<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
