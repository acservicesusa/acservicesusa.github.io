<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Uniontown OH</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

The likewise quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
