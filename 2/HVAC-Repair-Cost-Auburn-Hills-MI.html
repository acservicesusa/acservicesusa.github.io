<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
