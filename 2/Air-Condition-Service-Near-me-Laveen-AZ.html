<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals should be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken until these problems have been fixed.<p>

Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not be able to cool the house properly. These are simply a few of the aspects that you require to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
