While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
