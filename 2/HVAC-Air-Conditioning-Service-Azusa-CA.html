The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power ought to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level.
