<p>In addition to these weather changes, we have actually also been the country's fastest growing city over the last years, including well over 100,000 individuals, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In a lot of areas of our nation, cooling is a standard need, suggesting the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have a/c. Likewise, real estate rates in Seattle have escalated, and as a result, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are also being transformed to complete bedrooms to include extra area. Spaces in the upper locations of houses are particularly vulnerable to getting uneasy and very hot throughout the summertime, making air conditioning much more necessary.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
