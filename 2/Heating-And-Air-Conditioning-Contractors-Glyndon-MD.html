<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
