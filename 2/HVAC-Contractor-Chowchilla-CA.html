<p>Iâ $ m really particular with my things. I like my equipment and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So buying this air conditioner to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough truth. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Because it has actually restored my faith in good production, am glad I got this though. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got given that I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested.
