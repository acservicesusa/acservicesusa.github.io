<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
