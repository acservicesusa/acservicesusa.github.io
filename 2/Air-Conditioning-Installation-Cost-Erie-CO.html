They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My better half said that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.

Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
