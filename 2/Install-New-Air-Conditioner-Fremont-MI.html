<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
