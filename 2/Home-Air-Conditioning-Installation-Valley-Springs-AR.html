<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources.

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Valley Springs AR</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the growth of biological impurities are damp or damp structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
