<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
