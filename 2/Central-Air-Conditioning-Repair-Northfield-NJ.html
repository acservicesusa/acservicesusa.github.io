The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
