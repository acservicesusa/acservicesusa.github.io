<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to determine if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on the time and location the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece next to your home's foundation. This kind of a/c unit likewise is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside your home through the home's outside wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged ac system, which is usually situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioners often include electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c unit and central heating system eliminates the requirement for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>A specific ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
