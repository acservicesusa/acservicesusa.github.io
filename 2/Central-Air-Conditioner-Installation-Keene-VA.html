<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Keene VA</h3>
<p>Created to improve producing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's development controlled not just temperature but also humidity Carrier used his understanding of the heating of items with steam and reversed the procedure. Rather of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and consequently the quantity of wetness in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature level and humidity assisted maintain constant paper dimensions and ink positioning. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase performance in the workplace, and The Provider Cooling Company of America was formed to fulfill rising demand. In time, air conditioning came to be used to enhance comfort in automobiles and houses too.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
