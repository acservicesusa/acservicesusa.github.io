<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a car radiator or typical family air conditioning unit does.
