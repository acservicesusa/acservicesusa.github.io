<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really important to keeping a correct temperature.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up till many years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
