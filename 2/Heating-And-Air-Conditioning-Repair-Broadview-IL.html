<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
