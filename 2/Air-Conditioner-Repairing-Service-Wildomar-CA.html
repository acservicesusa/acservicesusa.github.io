This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
