<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
