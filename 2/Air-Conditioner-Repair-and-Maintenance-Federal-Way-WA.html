<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which normally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
