<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Scotts Mills OR Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Most people don't know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining appropriately. A constraint in your drain pipelines causes a water leakage. There are several locations a blockage can take place. Among the main areas where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
