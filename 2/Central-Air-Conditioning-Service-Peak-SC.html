<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Peak SC</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
