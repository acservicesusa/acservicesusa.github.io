<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
