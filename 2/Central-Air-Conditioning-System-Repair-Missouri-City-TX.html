<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
