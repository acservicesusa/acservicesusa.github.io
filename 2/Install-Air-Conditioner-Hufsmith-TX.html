<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
