<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office devices; furniture, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
