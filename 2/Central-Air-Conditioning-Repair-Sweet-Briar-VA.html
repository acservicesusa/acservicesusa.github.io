<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me.
