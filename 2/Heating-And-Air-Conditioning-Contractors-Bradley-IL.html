<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially expensive to install, especially in an older house. Depending on the kind of system set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment may require unique licenses, and there is restricted versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
