<h3>Which Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Darwin CA?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
