<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power depends on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a offered and trustworthy  source of energy.<p>
