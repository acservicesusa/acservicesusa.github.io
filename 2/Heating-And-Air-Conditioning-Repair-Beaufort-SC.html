Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
