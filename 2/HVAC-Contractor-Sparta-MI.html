<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To discover odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
