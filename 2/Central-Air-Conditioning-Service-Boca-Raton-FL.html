<p>Many commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into a space per an unit of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, air-conditioning and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. a really advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
