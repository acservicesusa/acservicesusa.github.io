<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
