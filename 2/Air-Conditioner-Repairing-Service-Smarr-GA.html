Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and must be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding.

Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
