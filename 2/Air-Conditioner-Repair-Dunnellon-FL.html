Pressed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
