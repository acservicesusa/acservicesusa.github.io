<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items.
