<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
