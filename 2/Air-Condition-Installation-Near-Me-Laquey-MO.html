<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
