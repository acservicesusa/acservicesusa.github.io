<p>Particular immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place the signs take place.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
