<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Center Kentucky</h3>
<p>New air conditioners normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating suggests greater energy performance and potentially lower energy costs.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
