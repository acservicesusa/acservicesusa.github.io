<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Midland AR Home</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
