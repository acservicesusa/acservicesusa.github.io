<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
