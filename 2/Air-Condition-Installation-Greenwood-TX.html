We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Homes can have the very same indoor air issues as single-family houses since much of the pollution sources, such as the interior building products, home furnishings, and home products, are similar.

This is a lot more affordable on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a home may be suitable for a larger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
