<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
