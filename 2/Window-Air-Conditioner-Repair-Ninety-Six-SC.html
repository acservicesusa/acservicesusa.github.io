<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
