<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
