<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation.
