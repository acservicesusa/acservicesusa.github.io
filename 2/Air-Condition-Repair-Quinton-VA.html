<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Quinton VA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
