<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of lowering direct exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease however not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking cigarettes produces such big quantities of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to considerably lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses substantially. Consequently, the most efficient method to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
